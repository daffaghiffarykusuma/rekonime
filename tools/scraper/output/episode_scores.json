Now a second-year high school student and the president of the Manga Research Club, Masamune spends a peaceful existence watching the adventures of the angel Liliel, his favorite character.\n\nIn the beginning of the academic year, Masamune’s life is turned upside down when he meets first-year student Ririsa Amano, a passionate cosplay practitioner. Despite Masamune's initial reluctance, the determined young woman manages to convince him to become her personal photographer for the production of a collection dedicated to their common favorite character: Liliel.\n\nAs Masamune enthusiastically discovers the world of cosplay and photo editing, he is unexpectedly reunited with his childhood friend Mikari Tachibana, who has become a model in the hope of impressing her beloved upperclassman. Realizing that modeling is not enough to intrigue the hopeless otaku, Mikari decides to join the club and become a cosplayer herself, all to finally have a chance at winning Masamune's heart. However, Masamune's love for fictional characters may not be capable of extending to those who impersonate them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

That same day, he is presented with a golden opportunity to clear his family's debt: a private tutoring gig for a wealthy family's daughter, with a wage of five times the market price. He accepts the proposal, but is horrified to discover that the client, Itsuki Nakano, is the girl he confronted earlier! \n\nAfter unsuccessfully trying to get back on Itsuki's good side, Uesugi finds out that his problems don't end there: Itsuki is actually a quintuplet, so in addition to her, he must also tutor her sisters—Miku, Yotsuba, Nino, and Ichika—who, despite the very real threat of flunking, want nothing to do with a tutor. However, his family's livelihood is on the line so Uesugi pushes on, adamant in his resolve to rid the sisters of their detest for studying and successfully lead them to graduation.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Deciding to make the most of the remaining holiday, Ayuko Uehara takes a stroll into her neighborhood and stops by a small cafe. However, her peaceful day is abruptly disturbed when a girl clumsily bumps into her. Left puzzled by the encounter, Ayuko is even more surprised when she meets them again as freshmen at the same high school she attends. Recognizing her from the store, the girls introduce themselves as Kanaka Amaya and Saki Iwasawa, and the three quickly become friends.\n\nAs they go through their daily lives as high school girls, the trio's distinct personalities—Kanaka's happy-go-lucky attitude, Saki's tomboyish behavior, and Ayuko's easygoingness—are sure to make every mundane school day filled with silly and fun interactions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But Akkun is still very much a boy in love; he shows his admiration for Katagiri in his own way. From tailing her in order to take her picture to eavesdropping in on her conversations, he ends up stalking his own girlfriend. \n\nLuckily enough, Katagiri finds Akkun's actions cute and endearing, and knows he doesn't really mean any of his insults. Even if their close friend, Masago Matsuo, finds their dynamic a little odd, Katagiri loves her sweet tyrant just the way he is.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Jinta and his group of childhood friends grew apart after her untimely death, but they are drawn together once more as they try to lay Menma's spirit to rest.

That is, until the national government tasks them with eliminating the greatest threat to their planet: their new teacher. \n\nHaving already destroyed the moon, the octopus-like professor—dubbed \"Koro-sensei\"—has now threatened to destroy the Earth by March of the following year. In light of their mission, the students have found that killing him is easier said than done. Not only can Koro-sensei move at speeds of up to Mach 20, but he can also resist almost every earthly weapon. Ironically, he also proves to be one of the best teachers Class 3-E has ever had. Training the class to excel in both their studies as students and skills as assassins, Koro-sensei is confident that his students' ingenuity and indomitable will could return them to the main campus. \n\nThrough trial and error, Nagisa Shiota, as well as the other students of Class 3-E, must figure out Koro-sensei's weaknesses—and fast, for the very fate of the world depends upon it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Ostracized by her female classmates in middle school for being a little too popular with the boys, she desperately strives to avoid a similar situation in high school by being unnecessarily noisy and graceless.\n\nNevertheless, scattered among Futaba's unpleasant memories are the treasured moments with the boy she had a crush on, Kou Tanaka. Unfortunately, that spell abruptly ended on a sour note when he suddenly stopped attending school and never came back. When Futaba finds out that Kou has returned—with a different last name this time—she can already feel the butterflies in her stomach. However, Kou Mabuchi is not the warm boy that she remembers from her days in middle school; he is now taller, more charismatic and withdrawn—making him far less approachable.\n\nFutaba believes that if she returns to her former self, Kou will begin to take notice of her again. But is she prepared to sacrifice her bubble of normalcy and risk losing her friends in the process?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Not willing to compete, Kasumi declines Olivia's offer to join the fun, but eventually gets involved anyway and dispenses her own brand of mischief. Soon, a strange friendship blossoms between the peculiar trio, and they decide to form the \"Pastime Club,\" where they are free to resume their daily hijinks. \n\nWhether it be failing to learn English, trying desperately to become popular, or getting caught by teachers at the wrong time, school life will never be boring when the girls of Asobi Asobase are up to their hilarious antics.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Atri, the salvaged robot with the appearance and demeanor of a young girl, reveals to Natsuki that Nonko has tasked her with an important mission, but she has forgotten what it was.\n\nAlthough Natsuki was initially planning to sell Atri, the opportunity to connect with his grandmother's research through Atri makes him rethink his decision. Natsuki once had to sacrifice his dream to partake in a prestigious scientific mission. But as he opens up to his fellow islanders, he discovers that he can still make a difference in a desolate world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When she realizes that the best way to get Atori to notice her is to be a delinquent, she begins to dress differently: she dyes parts of her hair a bright red, wears clips on her ears to resemble piercings, and attaches jumbo erasers to her shoes to give them thicker soles.\n\nDespite Yuu's best efforts and even with the advice of her \"natural born delinquent\" friend Suzu Suzukaze, all of her plans to be a bad girl go awry. Still, Yuu manages to befriend Atori and pledges to spend as much time as possible together, not knowing there are others vying for Atori's attention. In the process, Yuu has also gained the attention of the school's self-proclaimed idol, Rura Ruriha, filling her once-invisible life with more attention than she may be able to handle.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, such a venture requires her to confront various hurdles with new friends she makes along the way, all in her pursuit to encounter that twinkling, heart-throbbing ardor once more.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As days fade into nights, she struggles to make ends meet until a certain cherished memory is tainted, pushing her to the edge.\n\nDriven by a fractured sense of purpose and the need to reclaim what she lost, Sakiko forms Ave Mujica, a masked symphonic metal band. Its members are bound not by a shared goal but by the fragile threads of their divergent desires. Together, they weave a haunting masquerade of loss and rebirth, captivating audiences with a gothic musical stage play. But as the girls' ideals collide, the scars of their pasts rear their ugly heads. The brittle facade the girls have built threatens to collapse beneath them, bringing Sakiko to the verge of falling apart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As most students play in a band as a hobby, Anon desires to fit in and spends her first days trying to recruit members for her own band, envisioning herself as the group's vocalist. She befriends Tomori Takamatsu, a shy girl who seems interested but hesitant about joining. As it turns out, Tomori used to be part of CRYCHIC, an experience that has scarred her deeply.\n\nThrough Tomori, Anon meets Taki Shiina and Soyo Nagasaki, both former members of the same band.

There are two types of Reflectors—those who wear blue rings to protect those falling into depravity by preserving their Fragments, and those who wear red rings to prevent negative emotions by stealing the Fragments of those who begin to develop severe woe.\n\nDespite wanting to socialize with people around her, transfer student Ruka Hanari's shy and introverted personality always gets in her way. In a chance encounter, however, she bumps into a woman who happens to drop a blue ring as she hurries away. Unable to return it, Ruka brings it back with her to her dorm. There, she meets the outgoing Hiori Hirahara, who also has a blue ring. They find themselves in several conflicts against red Reflectors, slowly realizing the true power of the rings that they hold.\n\nNow striving to become Reflectors themselves, Ruka and Hiori must learn to work together and become stronger so that they can save not only the people around them, but also themselves from the emotions that hold them back.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This is his chance to make things right.\n \nBoku dake ga Inai Machi follows Satoru in his mission to uncover what truly transpired 18 years ago and prevent the death of his classmate while protecting those he cares about in the present.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It is during these encounters that Ichikawa realizes his model classmate is actually an airhead who can never read the room. As they spend more time together, the boy cannot help but feel not only a sense of endearment toward the very girl he wishes to murder but also a desire to protect her at all costs.

Following the sudden retirement of all players of FOX ONE—Nozomi's father’s esports team—Shun learns that the Inatsuki family is in severe debt. In order to repay the money they owe, Shun reluctantly agrees to participate in an online game tournament: Xaxerion Championship.\n\nJoined by their classmate Akito Sendou, the three of them scout for talented players to rebuild the team. Although they are lucky to find two promising additions to FOX ONE, it is too soon to celebrate: if Shun does not let go of his guilty conscience, the makeshift team stands no chance at winning the tournament.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Additionally, his jealousy toward the success of the \"Platinum Generation\"—a group of similarly-aged creators—has caused him to regret his decision to attend a traditional university instead of an arts college. Even though he believes there are no second chances in life, Kyouya is suddenly given one when he wakes up one day and finds himself 10 years in the past.\n\nInstead of choosing business school like he originally had, Kyouya decides to pursue his passions and attends the Oonaka University of Art. There, he meets classmate Eiko Kawasegawa, the woman who had hired him as an intern in the present, alongside his new housemates and future Platinum Generation members: underachieving artist Aki Shino, aspiring singer and actress Nanako Kogure, and naturally-gifted writer Tsurayuki Rokuonji.\n\nWith each project they complete together, Kyouya and his friends venture closer to discovering their true potential as creators and remaking their lives into the ideal versions they desire.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This is all due to the efforts of the Allied Shinobi Forces and the village's Seventh Hokage, Naruto Uzumaki. Now resembling a modern metropolis, Konohagakure has changed, particularly the life of a shinobi. Under the watchful eye of Naruto and his old comrades, a new generation of shinobi has stepped up to learn the ways of the ninja.\n\nBoruto Uzumaki is often the center of attention as the son of the Seventh Hokage. Despite having inherited Naruto's boisterous and stubborn demeanor, Boruto is considered a prodigy and is able to unleash his potential with the help of supportive friends and family. Unfortunately, this has only worsened his arrogance and his desire to surpass Naruto which, along with his father's busy lifestyle, has strained their relationship. However, a sinister force brewing within the village may threaten Boruto's carefree life.\n\nNew friends and familiar faces join Boruto as a new story begins.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The bright lights and merry atmosphere guide Miri to a big hotel and a man with a delicious-looking cake. However, the child has just unknowingly walked into the center of an elaborate, foolproof plan for assassinating a dangerous mafia boss.\n\nProfessional assassins Kazuki Kurusu and Rei Suwa live together, fleeing memories of their grim childhoods and avoiding emotional connections. When their mission goes awry and they end up bringing Miri home, there is only one reasonable thing to do: return Miri to her mother. But the girl's innocent laugh and pure worldview quickly enamor her to Kazuki, who secretly enjoys playing a parent, and it is not long before Rei's impenetrable heart makes room for Miri.\n\nMiri's every move is unpredictable, and Kazuki and Rei find raising an energetic child harder than any of their missions. Although it presents a great risk to their careers, Kazuki and Rei—both assuming the affectionate nickname \"papa\"—decide to provide Miri with a normal childhood despite all the odds stacked against them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Though it only lasts for five seconds at a time, Yuu's mysterious power allowed him to cheat his way to the top of his class and  enter a prestigious high school, where he continues his dishonest acts.\n\nHis shenanigans are eventually stopped by Nao Tomori—the headstrong student council president from Hoshinoumi Academy—who sees through his deceit. Through coercion, Nao convinces Yuu to transfer to Hoshinoumi and join the student council. Hoshinoumi Academy is secretly an institution created for adolescents who possess supernatural abilities—with the student council serving as a means of locating those who abuse their powers.\n\nWith Yuu begrudgingly assisting in council affairs, the group sets out to find and protect new ability users from harm. However, as they further investigate the abilities, their findings entangle them in far more complicated matters than they could ever imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They might go as far as seeing themselves capable of wielding mystical powers, or maybe even believe themselves to have descended from a fantasy realm. This \"disease\" is known as \"chuunibyou\" and is often the source of some of the most embarrassing moments of a person's life.\n\nFor Yuuta Togashi, the scars that his chuunibyou has left behind are still fresh. Having posed as the \"Dark Flame Master\" during his middle school years, he looks back at those times with extreme embarrassment, so much so that he decides to attend a high school far away where nobody will recognize him. Putting his dark history behind him, he longs to live a normal high school life.\n\nUnfortunately, he hasn't escaped his past yet: enter Rikka Takanashi, Yuuta's new classmate and self-declared vessel of the \"Wicked Eye.\" As this eccentric young girl crashes into Yuuta's life, his dream of an ordinary, chuunibyou-free life quickly crumbles away. In this hilarious and heartwarming story of a boy who just wants to leave his embarrassing memories behind, the delusions of old are far from a thing of the past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To a fashionable socialite like Yuzu, this inconvenient event is just another opportunity to make new friends, fall in love, and finally experience a first kiss. Unfortunately, Yuzu's dreams and style do not conform with her new ultrastrict, all-girls school, filled with obedient shut-ins and overachieving grade-skippers. Her gaudy appearance manages to grab the attention of Mei Aihara, the beautiful and imposing student council president, who immediately proceeds to sensually caress Yuzu's body in an effort to confiscate her cellphone.\n\nThoroughly exhausted from her first day, Yuzu arrives home and discovers a shocking truth—Mei is actually her new step-sister! Though Yuzu initially tries to be friendly with her, Mei's cold shoulder routine forces Yuzu to begin teasing her. But before Yuzu can finish her sentence, Mei forces her to the ground and kisses her, with Yuzu desperately trying to break free. Once done, Mei storms out of the room, leaving Yuzu to ponder the true nature of her first kiss, and the secrets behind the tortured expression in the eyes of her new sister.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She wants to draw manga about high school girls, but her storyboards are bland, her art uninspired, and her premises weak. Her concerned, exasperated editor comes up with an idea: push Chaos to be more social. So, by her recommendation, Chaos moves into a dormitory for female manga artists. She soon meets the other residents: Tsubasa Katsuki, a shounen manga artist; Ruki Irokawa, who draws erotic manga popular with women; and Koyume Koizuka, a shoujo artist who, like Chaos, has yet to be serialized. Quickly striking up a friendship with these girls, Chaos finds new inspiration for her manga and continues to grow her creativity.\n\nComic Girls is a showcase of the daily lives of these manga artists. Will Chaos finally be able to make her debut and become serialized? None of the girls know, but they will all do their best to help each other become the best artists they can be.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

His grandfather's will states that, in order to inherit his manor and everything inside it, he must take guardianship over the Bibliotheca Mystica de Dantalian—an archive that contains forbidden knowledge—and also  take care of a mysterious girl called Dalian. \n\nAs Huey settles into the manor, an old rival of his grandfather's arranges a meeting with him. Dalian, knowing the rival to be Wesley's killer, tags along and discovers that the murderer is in possession of a Phantom Book—a cursed tome that Wesley tried to seal away. When the book puts the two in danger, Huey discovers that the Bibliotheca Mystica de Dantalian and Dalian are one and the same, and she entrusts Huey with the key to unlocking the knowledge stored within her. Together, Dalian and Huey seal the book away, and thus begins an unlikely partnership as they solve mysteries caused by other Phantom Books.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He finally decides to return after hearing that his father—owner of the Kyoto sweets store Ryokushou—has been hospitalized. Worrying that no one would inherit the shop if his father passes away, Nagomu prepares himself to embrace his family's legacy and the art of making sweets⁠.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Nagomu discovers that his father has already chosen a different successor—a 10-year-old girl named Itsuka Yukihira, who was abandoned at Ryokushou by her father for reasons unknown. While she has since become a part of the family and is now the shop's poster girl, Itsuka still longs to see her father and follows all possible clues that may lead her to him. Sympathizing with Itsuka's situation, Nagomu's mother asks Nagomu to act as Itsuka's father, hoping that Itsuka will open up to him and relieve her pain, even if just a little.\n\nStarting on bad terms, Itsuka and Nagomu gradually learn more about each other, realizing that they are more similar than they had thought. Connected by their mutual love for both Ryokushou and its confections, their relationship as child and father figure begins to make lives around them a little bit sweeter.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As a result, schools have begun incorporating these technologies into their curriculum, leaving behind the ways of the old. One such institution is the elite Yuyu Girls' Vocational High School, where both Serufu Yua and her childhood friend, Miku \"Purin\" Suride, have applied. Although the tech-savvy Purin is accepted to Yuyu High, the accident-prone Serufu is rejected and enters the traditional Gatagata Girls' High School instead, driving a wedge into their friendship.\n\nOn her way to class one day, Serufu gets into a bike accident, and Rei Yasaku, a passerby who attends the same school, fixes her damaged bicycle. Serufu later finds out that Rei has a passion for old-fashioned crafts and is the head of the school's Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Club—which is in danger of closing due to a lack of members.\n\nRealizing that this may be her chance to repair her relationship with Purin, Serufu joins the club in hopes of creating projects that could bring them together once more. As the DIY Club welcomes new faces, Serufu learns to build not only handicrafts but also new friendships along the way!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Such is the case for Natsuo Fujii, who has found himself entranced by his school's ever-cheerful teacher Hina. Deflated by this unreachable desire, Natsuo humors his friends and attends a mixer. There he meets Rui, a girl whose lack of excitement rivals that of himself. After bonding over their mutual awkwardness, Rui takes Natsuo to her house and asks him to have sex with her, hoping that the experience will stop her friends from treating her like a clueless child. With his hopeless feelings towards Hina still on his mind, Natsuo hesitantly agrees.\n\nEqually unfulfilled by their \"first times,\" the two decide to part ways as strangers. However, before he even has a chance to process this experience, Natsuo's father drops a major bombshell: he is getting remarried, and his new wife Tsukiko Tachibana is coming over now to meet Natsuo. As if that was not enough of a shock, her daughters—and, in turn, Natsuo's new sisters—are Hina and Rui Tachibana, the woman he's in love with and the girl with whom he shared his first night. Now, Natsuo must come to terms with the feelings he has for his step-siblings as his eyes open to a darker side of love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But the incantation goes awry, sending Yusha and her friends back to a time before the Demon Lord, before Yusha becomes the Hero, and before the party had even graduated as adventurers. With their memories of the future erased, the four girls restart their ambitions to become the Hero's Party, aspiring to defeat the Demon Lord.\n\nHowever, in a sudden twist of fate, the Demon Lord was also sent back in time with her memories intact.

But the sudden death of their parents tears their new family apart, resulting in Sagiri becoming a shut-in which cut her off from her brother and society.\n\nWhile caring for what's left of his family, Masamune earns a living as a published light novel author with one small problem: he's never actually met his acclaimed illustrator, Eromanga-sensei, infamous for drawing the most lewd erotica. Through an embarrassing chain of events, he learns that his very own little sister was his partner the whole time!\n\nAs new characters and challenges appear, Masamune and Sagiri must now face the light novel industry together. Eromanga-Sensei follows the development of their relationship and their struggle to become successful; and as Sagiri slowly grows out of her shell, just how long will she be able to hide her true persona from the rest of the world?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, the entertainment industry is not all fun and games, as she fails her auditions one after another and struggles to sell her songs.\n\nFinding herself still standing at the start line, Hiyori pursues her only opportunity to take the next step forward—partaking in Extreme Hearts. The popular event is a Hyper Sports tournament where participants compete in various sports using ability-enhancing gear for a chance to make their big break. Despite being athletic, however, Hiyori's lack of familiarity with Hyper Sports poses a problem for her. Fortunately, she befriends girls experienced in different sports, and they join the tournament alongside Hiyori, hoping to see her rise to the top.\n\nNow playing under Team RISE, Hiyori and her teammates learn about the unspoken rule of Extreme Hearts—all competitors must be entertainers or aspire to be one. For the members of Team RISE, facing the competition head-on is an inspiring endeavor that paves the way to discovering newfound interests and everlasting friendships.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Originally from Japan, his jet-black hair and dark brown eyes cause his peers to shun him and give him the nickname \"Black Reaper,\" based on a popular urban legend about the traveler who brings death in the spring.\n\nOn a day like any other, Kujou visits the school's extravagant library in search of ghost stories. However, his focus soon changes as he becomes curious about a golden strand of hair on the stairs. The steps lead him to a large garden and a beautiful doll-like girl known as Victorique de Blois, whose complex and imaginative foresight allows her to predict their futures, now intertwined.\n\nWith more mysteries quickly developing—including the appearance of a ghost ship and an alchemist with the power of transmutation—Victorique and Kujou, bound by fate and their unique skills, have no choice but to rely on each other.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Due to her profession, she unexpectedly receives constant criticism from disgruntled citizens. Disheartened by the hostile treatment, she decides to submit a letter of resignation after just a few months of employment.\n\nBut on the same day Mai chooses to quit, she meets Seiko Fuji—the former ace of the Criminal Affairs Division who is assigned as her new instructor. Finding her new coworker to be enchanting, Mai delays leaving and gives her uninspiring job a second chance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After drowning his sorrows at a bar with his good friend Hashimoto, Yoshida headed back to his home in a drunken stupor, only to run into Sayu Ogiwara, a runaway high schooler. She asked him to let her stay the night, and with his judgment clouded by alcohol, Yoshida complied.\n\nNow, with his head on straight but with no memory of last night's events, Yoshida has Sayu explain just how she ended up sleeping at his apartment. Having listened to her story, Yoshida finds himself unable to kick her out—especially after learning that she came all the way from Hokkaido! So, despite his reservations about sheltering an underage girl, Yoshida allows her to stay, and their life together begins.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

So, Hina moves into the Hitotose Manor in the bustling city of Tokyo to study at Fujiyama High School, aspiring to join the school's renowned theater club.\n\nBut to Hina's dismay, she learns that Fujiyama High's theater club has been on a lengthy hiatus. Having already come to Tokyo and enrolled in the school, Hina is at a loss for what to do next. Sensing her disappointment and eagerness to learn theater, Chiaki Hagino, the landlady of Hitotose Manor, encourages Hina to create a troupe with the residents of Hitotose Manor as its members.\n\nHinako Note follows Hina as she begins a new life in Tokyo attending Fujiyama High while learning the ropes of theater with the support of her friends along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, wanting to help her, Kai severs ties with Bocchi and promises to reconcile with her when she befriends all of her classmates in her new middle school class.\n\nEven though Bocchi has no faith in herself, she is determined to be friends with Kai again. Summoning all of her courage, Bocchi takes on the daunting challenge of making friends with her entire class, starting with the delinquent-looking girl sitting in front of her...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After seeing their bountiful library, she throws herself headfirst into the Church's grasp and begs to join their order. In exchange for her service and her unusually bountiful supply of mana, Myne is given the blue robes of a noble-born apprentice priestess, despite being a commoner. To Myne, all this talk of mana and nobility is trivial, as she now has access to an unlimited supply of books!\n\nAs Myne transitions into the next phase of her life in this new world, she soon learns that achieving her dream has come at a heavy cost. Noble society is severe, unforgiving, and fueled by politics and neglect. She must now deal with the class conflict between the noble-born blue robes and the common-born grey robes, the High Priest's attempts to oust her, and constant behavioral issues from her new retainers. With the help of her family, friends, and the enigmatic Head Priest whose loyalties and motives remain unknown, Myne seeks to overcome these obstacles and continue on the path to becoming her ideal self—the ultimate librarian!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, due to her immense knowledge and extraordinary amount of mana, she has garnered the attention of many dangerous people, who are willing to do anything to get their hands on Myne.\n\nTo keep her safe, the Head Priest assigns Myne a bodyguard and advises her to be adopted by a noble, a decision that will force her to leave her family behind. As Myne is opposed to the idea, the Head Priest gives her an ultimatum: she can be with her family until she turns 10, but if she is deemed too unstable, she will immediately be dealt with.\n\nPlaced in a tough position, Myne is uncertain about her future. Despite the twists that may lie ahead, she will do whatever she can to protect those that she loves—even if it means giving up on her dream.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, a fateful meeting between the two lays both of their hidden selves bare. Even though she is popular at school, Hori has little time to socialize with her friends due to housework. On the other hand, Miyamura lives under the noses of his peers, his body bearing secret tattoos and piercings that make him look like a gentle delinquent.\n\nHaving opposite personalities yet sharing odd similarities, the two quickly become friends and often spend time together in Hori's home. As they both emerge from their shells, they share with each other a side of themselves concealed from the outside world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Her view on the sport changes, now looking forward to all the delightful experiences she can take part in alongside her fellow club members.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, each individual must also deal with their own issues, whether it is struggling to meet a deadline or coming to terms with traumatic events buried in their past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Moreover, he is completely outclassed by those around him: fellow club member Tomoyo Kanzaki manipulates time, Jurai's childhood friend Hatoko Kushikawa wields control over the five elements, club president Sayumi Takanashi can repair both inanimate objects and living things, and their adviser's niece Chifuyu Himeki is able to create objects out of thin air.\n\nHowever, while the mystery of why they received these powers looms overhead, very little has changed for the Literature Club. The everyday lives of these five superpowered students continue on, albeit now tinged with the supernatural.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He decides to start meeting with Kaori every day in the hopes of beginning to understand her better. The more time they spend together, the more she begins to open up to him. However, nearing the end of the week, she starts to push him away once more. It is then revealed to him the reason for Kaori's cold front: at the end of the week, her memories of those close to her, excluding her family, are forgotten, as they are reset every Monday. The result of an accident in middle school, the once popular and kind Kaori is now unable to make friends in fear of hurting the people dear to her.\n\nDetermined to become more than just one week friends, Yuuki asks her the exact same question each Monday: \"Would you like to be friends?\" Because he knows that deep down, Kaori wishes for that more than anything.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Among them are Mio Natsume, a girl burdened with lingering feelings; Hazuki Morikawa, a member of the concert band but distant from the others; and Haruto Souma, an athlete obsessed with baseball. Meanwhile, second-year student Ena Komiya seeks to revive the photography club to its former glory, refusing to let the organization be disbanded. Though this group lacks a strong connection with one another, their lives suddenly cross paths with the arrival of a third-year transfer student.\n\nWhile a transfer so close to graduation is unusual for most, it is business as usual for Eita Izumi. Due to his father's work, he has never been able to stay in one place for very long. But as luck would have it, their most recent relocation has returned Eita to his hometown for his final semester of high school. For better or worse, it also sparks the rekindling of old relationships left behind in the past.\n\nWith graduation already causing its own share of anxieties, Eita's sudden arrival brings these students' carefree days to an abrupt end. Long-forgotten memories, deeply buried emotions, and inspiring new passions—everything is brought to light in their bittersweet final semester.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Without warning, Mami breaks up with him, leaving him utterly heartbroken and lonely. Seeking to soothe the pain, he hires a rental girlfriend through an online app. His partner is Chizuru Mizuhara, who through her unparalleled beauty and cute demeanor, manages to gain Kazuya's affection.\n\nBut after reading similar experiences other customers had had with Chizuru, Kazuya believes her warm smile and caring personality were all just an act to toy with his heart, and he rates her poorly. Aggravated, Chizuru lambastes him for his shameless hypocrisy, revealing her true pert and hot-tempered self. This one-sided exchange is cut short, however, when Kazuya finds out that his grandmother has collapsed.\n\nThey dash toward the hospital and find Kazuya's grandmother already in good condition. Baffled by Chizuru's presence, she asks who this girl might be. On impulse, Kazuya promptly declares that they are lovers, forcing Chizuru to play the part. But with Kazuya still hung up on his previous relationship with Mami, how long can this difficult client and reluctant rental girlfriend keep up their act?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

A battle of wits, a contest of physical prowess, a test of courage—any strategy he employs to expose her weaknesses is to no avail. On the contrary, Nishikata's pitiful attempts only reveal more of his own flaws, which Takagi takes advantage of to become increasingly daring in her teasing attempts. To make things worse for Nishikata, rumors about him and Takagi may have spread in class due to the frequent interactions between them.\n\nHowever, the optimistic Nishikata believes that wisdom comes with age and that as the days go by, his experience with her constant teasing will eventually bear fruit, leading him to the awaited moment of victory. Thus, Nishikata continues to strive for the seemingly impossible—to outsmart Takagi and make her blush with embarrassment.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, none of these qualities help Rentarou with his love life. On the day of his middle school graduation, he is once again turned down by a girl he confesses to, earning his one-hundredth rejection in a row. Down on his luck, he goes to a matchmaking shrine and wishes to finally get a girlfriend in high school.\n\nWhen the god of the shrine suddenly appears before him, Rentarou is told he will meet an astronomical total of one hundred soulmates in high school. Though Rentarou initially does not take this foretelling seriously, his doubts disappear when, on the first day of school, he meets two of these soulmates—Hakari Hanazono and Karane Inda—who both confess to him. With fated encounters and love confessions galore, Rentarou's life is about to get a lot more exciting.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When Magari discovers that she and Nakami have something in common, she offers to share her secret sleeping spot with her fellow insomniac. As the two find warmth in each other's company, the struggles they face start to become easier to confront.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But their fists only just manage to make him blink, as even emotions are far from his grasp.\n\nHowever, one day Katsuhira, Chidori, and four other teenagers are abducted and forced to join the Kizuna System as official \"Kiznaivers.\" Those taking part are connected through pain: if one member is injured, the others will feel an equal amount of agony. These individuals must become the lab rats and scapegoats of an incomplete system designed with world peace in mind.

For Yukari Nejima, a teen that considers himself average in every way, this system might be his best shot at living a fulfilling life.\n\nHowever, spurred by his infatuation for his classmate and long-time crush, Misaki Takasaki, Yukari defies the system and confesses his love. After some initial reluctance, Misaki reciprocates his feelings in a moment of passion. Unfortunately, before the two can further their relationship, Yukari receives his marriage notice. He is then thrown into a confusing web of love and lies when his less-than-thrilled assigned partner, Ririna Sanada, becomes fascinated with his illicit romance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Though their time together was short, Ao showed Mira the wonders of astronomy, from orbiting planets to distant stars. Before they parted, Mira learned that a star with her name exists, but there are none with Ao's. And so, she forged a promise: one day, she would discover a new asteroid and name it after Ao.\n\nYears later, Mira is still fascinated with astronomy. Now in high school at Hoshizaki Academy, she tries to join the Astronomy Club. Unfortunately, she finds out that the club has been merged with the Geology Club to form a single Earth Sciences Club. She joins this new club and finds a pleasant surprise—she reunites with Ao after years of separation.\n\nAlongside their new clubmates, Mira and Ao begin their journey together to fulfill their promise. How hard could it possibly be to find an asteroid?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

His peers now recognize him as someone to eliminate for a chance to sit next to the most beautiful girl in class.\n\nGorgeous and graceful with long, dark hair, Komi is universally adored and immensely popular despite her mysterious persona. However, unbeknownst to everyone, she has crippling anxiety and a communication disorder which prevents her from wholeheartedly socializing with her classmates.\n\nWhen left alone in the classroom, a chain of events forces Komi to interact with Tadano through writing on the blackboard, as if in a one-way conversation. Being the first person to realize she cannot communicate properly, Tadano picks up the chalk and begins to write as well. He eventually discovers that Komi's goal is to make one hundred friends during her time in high school. To this end, he decides to lend her a helping hand, thus also becoming her first-ever friend.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unlike all other classmates who constantly fawn over her, Medaka frowns every time they interact. Seeing his disinterest as something to be rectified, Mona pulls out all the stops in the hopes of winning Medaka over, only to be met with one stern face after another.\n\nTurns out, Medaka's indifference to Mona stems from his wish to one day become a monk, and hence must leave all worldly desires behind. As the unknowing Mona ramps up her attacks on Medaka, all her antics might lead her into falling for him instead.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Tiara's group is ranked Lapis, and if that was not enough, those who fail while ranked Lapis face expulsion. Realizing their dire situation, Tiara urges everyone to start taking their activities more seriously.\n\nOn top of this, Tiara has one more purpose for excelling at the academy: to become more like her elder sister, who is a very skilled singer.

Together with Yuu, they begin restoring the school idol club, hoping to recreate the idol performances that dazzled them before.\n\nLove Live!

Inspired by the former superstar school idol group μ's, Chika is determined to start her own school idol club in her seaside hometown at Uranohoshi Girl's High School. But even before gathering any students to join the group, the aspiring school idol finds her greatest obstacle to be student council president Dia Kurosawa who stands firmly against the creation of the club.\n\nJust when it seems there is no hope, Chika meets Riko Sakurauchi, a transfer student from Otonokizaka High School, home of μ's. Somewhat shy but a talented piano player, Chika believes her to be a promising recruit, though convincing her to join is easier said than done. In spite of that, Chika chooses to charge forward and overcome the obstacles keeping her from forming a school idol group that shines as bright as the nine that came before her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

      "synopsis": "The number of terrorist acts in Japan has never been lower, thanks to the efforts of a syndicate called Direct Attack (DA). The organization raises orphaned girls as killers to carry out assassinations under their \"Lycoris\" program. Takina Inoue is an exceptional Lycoris with a strong sense of purpose and a penchant for perfection. Unfortunately, a hostage situation tests her patience, and the resulting act of insubordination leads to her transfer out of DA. Not thrilled about losing the only place she belonged to, she reluctantly arrives at her new base of operations—LycoReco, a cafe in disguise.\n\nTakina's new partner, however, turns out to be quite different from what she imagined. Despite being the famed Lycoris prodigy, Chisato Nishikigi appears almost unconcerned with her duties. She drags Takina along on all kinds of odd jobs under the simple explanation of helping people in need. Takina is even more puzzled when Chisato takes down a group of armed assailants without killing any of them. Feeling like a fish out of water, Takina itches to get reinstated into DA—but Chisato is determined to prove to her that there is more to a life than just taking them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They convince Hayato to change his mind, albeit reluctantly. Through this encounter, Hayato eventually remembers his past with his grandmother as well as his love for the cafe.\n\nNow resolved to carry on his grandmother's legacy, Hayato enlists the girls to act as the \"goddesses\" that will ensure the preservation of this precious abode.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Or, at the very least, they pretend to be the city's defenders. In reality, the Colors are just three young girls: the shy Yui Akamatsu, the noisy Sacchan, and the video game-loving Kotoha, who spend their time playing make-believe and exploring the city. The Colors' activities are facilitated by the grandfatherly Daigorou \"Pops\" Kujiraoka, who uses his store's inventory of knick-knacks to entertain the rambunctious trio.\n\nNot everyone is a fan of the Colors though. The local policeman Saitou just wants to deal with his regular duties, but he often finds himself the target of the Colors' attention, having been made the villain in most of their fantasies. But despite his personal feelings, Saitou always finds the time to go along with the three girls' games. Even though the Colors do not actually defend Ueno, they definitely help brighten everyone's day.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Now Akatsuki, the mysterious organization of elite rogue ninja, is closing in on their grand plan which may threaten the safety of the entire shinobi world.\n \nAlthough Naruto is older and sinister events loom on the horizon, he has changed little in personality—still rambunctious and childish—though he is now far more confident and possesses an even greater determination to protect his friends and home. Come whatever may, Naruto will carry on with the fight for what is important to him, even at the expense of his own body, in the continuation of the saga about the boy who wishes to become Hokage.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

So when she graduates from high school, it is no surprise that she applies to work at Eagle Jump, the company responsible for making her favorite video game. On her first day, she is excited to learn that she will be working on a new installment to the series: Fairies Story 3—and even more so under Kou Yagami, the lead character designer.\n\nIn their department are people who share the same passion for games. There is Yun Iijima, whose specialty is designing monsters; the shy Hifumi Takimoto, who prefers to communicate through instant messaging; Hajime Shinoda, an animation team member with an impressive figurine collection; Rin Tooyama, the orderly art director; Shizuku Hazuki, the game director who brings her cat to work; and Umiko Ahagon, the short-tempered head programmer.\n\nNew Game! follows Aoba and the others on their adventure through the ups and downs of game making, from making the perfect character design to fixing all the errors that will inevitably accumulate in the process.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, fate puts her in an encounter with Satoko Kusagukare, a runaway ninja hunted by her comrades for accidentally leaving her village.\n\nWhen Konoha kills one of the people seeking Satoko, the mysterious girl uses her exceptional ability to cover up corpses. Seeing potential in Satoko's skill, Konoha offers her a deal: she can live with Konoha in exchange for cleaning up the scenes of her assassinations. As the ninja and the assassin now live under one roof, they begin enjoying their new life together, whether at home or during their conveniently aligned collaborations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Her new school has only five students including herself, all sharing a single classroom regardless of grade level. There are no convenience stores in the area, and it can take up to two hours for a bus to arrive.\n\nNevertheless, Hotaru finds herself captivated by the countryside's charm thanks to her four unique schoolmates with whom she quickly forms a genuine bond. The most colorful of them is Renge Miyauchi, a first-grader who is often perceptive despite her age. However, no less intriguing are the three Koshigaya siblings: the quiet oldest brother Suguru, the petite older sister Komari, and the prankish youngest sister Natsumi.\n\nHaving someone from the city join their cheerful little group enlivens the ordinary days in Asahigaoka. Not only does Hotaru bring firsthand knowledge from the alluring outside world, but her fresh outlook on life welcomes a blossom of change to their usual routine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They soon begin their new life together in their dormitory, the Mouse House. But there is no time to get settled as the girls awaken to a shocking reality: Fruit Tart is in a deep debt of one hundred million yen and has not even started yet!\n\nWith the possibility of Fruit Tart breaking up and the Mouse House being torn down if they cannot repay the money, the girls must work their way up from the bottom of idol society by making a name for themselves and writing their own songs. Luckily, Hemo Midori, an experienced idol, is a huge fan of Sakura and decides to join the group. With smiles on their faces, Sakura and the other girls work hard to become popular idols while making sure that each day is as fun as the last.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When a traveling merchant named Kraft Lawrence stops at the settlement, Holo offers to become his business partner if he takes her to her northern home of Yoitsu.

However, as Lawrence travels the countryside with Holo in search of economic opportunities, he begins to realize that his aspirations are slowly morphing into something unexpected.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With her reputation at stake, Kirino places a gag order on her sibling while simultaneously introducing him to the world of eroge and anime. Through Kirino, Kyousuke encounters the gothic lolita Ruri Gokou and the bespectacled otaku Saori Makishima, thus jump-starting an entirely new lifestyle. But as he becomes more and more involved in his little sister's secret life, it becomes that much harder to keep under wraps. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Having no intention to delve into romance, Eita devotes his entire high school life to his studies in order to become a doctor.\n\nIt did not take long for the beautiful and popular Masuzu Natsukawa to notice Eita's apathy. Tired of being the object of people's affection, she asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend, as she too feels disgusted at the notion of love. Eita, however, refuses—yet Masuzu has one trick left up her sleeve: Eita’s journal and threatening to post the embarrassing content online if he does not comply.\n\nNow entangled in a fake romance with the most desired girl at school, Eita's life is turned upside down. Whether envied by his peers or receiving a confession, he must cope with his newfound relationship and all the troubles that come along with it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Having led his army through countless grueling victories, Kongming falls gravely ill during the Battle of Wuzhang Plains. The weariness and regret stemming from the seemingly never-ending war catch up to him, and as he draws his final breath, Kongming wishes that if he were to reincarnate, he would be reborn in a more peaceful era.\n\nHis wish comes true, and Kongming wakes up in modern-day Tokyo with a younger body and his memories intact. Thrust into an unfamiliar world, he finds his way into a nightclub and meets Eiko Tsukimi, an aspiring singer whose performance immediately captivates him. Pitying his confusion, Eiko takes Kongming under her wing and teaches him about the current world, which leads to Kongming's interest in contemporary music. Seeing Eiko's immense musical potential, Kongming vows to make the world recognize her and soon takes on the role of her manager.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the music industry is unforgiving to those who make even the slightest mistakes. Still, Kongming is determined to accomplish his goals—even if he must utilize the war stratagems he famously used in his previous life!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

For one, Megumi Katou still has an incredibly flat personality and is unable to fit the role of Tomoya's ideal heroine. The other members of Blessing Software, Eriri Spencer Sawamura, Utaha Kasumigaoka, and Michiru Hyoudou, often forget she is even there due to her lack of presence and character. \n\nThroughout the development of their game, Blessing Software learns the struggles of working in an industry where deadlines must be met and edits are made constantly, and the hardships of working in a group setting.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Thus, when the relatively tame Sorata Kanda is transferred to the dorm, escaping this insane asylum becomes his foremost goal. Trapped there for the time being, he must learn how to deal with his fellow residents, including bubbly animator Misaki Kamiigusa, charming playboy writer Jin Mitaka, and the ever-reclusive Ryuunosuke Akasaka. Surrounded by weirdness, Sorata frequently finds respite in his interactions with his one \"normal\" friend, aspiring voice actress Nanami Aoyama.\n\nWhen Mashiro Shiina—a new foreign exchange student—joins the dormitory, Sorata is instantly enraptured by her beauty. Underneath her otherworldly appearance, Mashiro is an autistic savant, capable of world-renowned brilliance in her art, yet unable to perform simple daily tasks. After Sorata ends up in charge of taking care of Mashiro, the two inevitably grow closer, with Sorata's initial desire to escape the dormitory becoming a forgotten goal.\n\nDespite their eccentricities, every resident is incredible in their own field, leaving Sorata to contend with his own lack of any particular skill. With brilliance all around him, he thus strives to become an equal to their talent. Revolving around the hardships and joys of its colorful cast, Sakura-sou no Pet na Kanojo is a heartwarming coming-of-age tale of friendship, love, ambition, and heartbreak—through the lens of an ordinary person surrounded by the extraordinary.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With an air of unapproachability, she is well known throughout the school, but none dare interact with her—that is until Sakuta sees her wandering the library in a bunny girl costume. Despite the getup, no one seems to notice her, and after confronting her, he realizes that she is another victim of Puberty Syndrome. As Sakuta tries to help Mai through her predicament, his actions bring him into contact with more girls afflicted with the elusive disease.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But Yasumi has a secret—she is actually Yumiko Satou, a high school girl who prefers loose clothes and flashy jewelry, a complete contradiction to her false professional persona.\n\nAs Yasumi, Yumiko is finally offered an exciting opportunity to do a radio program alongside another up-and-coming voice actor she admires: Yuuhi Yuugure. In Yumiko’s eyes, Yuuhi’s cute looks and talented acting embody what a voice actor should be. As soon as they are introduced at the recording studio, however, Yumiko realizes that Yuuhi is actually her gloomy classmate, Chika Watanabe. Together, the pair commit to their radio program and slowly begin to open up. In supporting each other, Yumikoi and Chika gradually learn to be true to themselves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Eventually, her opportunity comes in the form of the seventh Selection Project—a brutal series of competitions best known as the starting point of the legendary idol Akari Amasawa.\n\nAnxious but excited, Suzune enters the preliminary round of Selection Project. Though her singing dazzles the judges and her fellow competitors, Suzune is unfortunately overcome by her nerves and freezes up in the middle of her performance. She recovers quickly, but the stumble is great enough that she loses the winning spot and is disqualified.\n\nOr so it seems—until Seira Kurusu, the girl Suzune lost to, announces that she plans to drop out of Selection Project, believing Suzune is a more talented singer and therefore deserves the right to compete. Suzune is caught off guard by the decision, but promises Seira that they will meet again as top idols. She prepares herself for the challenging obstacles that lie ahead.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite their difference in personalities, Emilico does what she can to carry out the needs of her master. As she learns more about her role and duty, Emilico begins to meet her fellow Dolls and their respective masters and comes to know more about the purpose of her existence.\n\n\"Do not fret over trivial matters,\" says one of the rules by which all Dolls must abide.

At the same time, Kukuru realizes that her ambitious goal might be more than she can handle. With mounting pressure from all around them, will Kukuru and Fuuka be able to save the one place they hold close to their hearts?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

A case of small-scale fires has escalated into serial arson, and Urino intends to predict the locations of future fires and identify the culprit. But his obsession with the case does not always reflect well on the club, and Osanai may not be so fond of her boyfriend's growing arrogance.\n\nMeanwhile, another supposedly unexceptional student, Jougorou Kobato, spends uneventful days with his girlfriend, Tokiko Nakamaru. However, when he witnesses a fire tied to a past case and Osanai herself, Kobato cannot help but slip back into his old, less-than-ordinary habits in search of the truth.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Upon awakening, he learns that a year into his slumber, a worldwide pandemic broke out, caused by the novel Male Killer (MK) virus which exclusively afflicts males and has killed all other men on Earth. \n\nFortunately, Reito and four other men were spared during their cryosleep and are now immune to the virus. As the only men left in the world, they are thus tasked with mating with as many women as possible to repopulate the planet. However, Reito is committed to his childhood friend and sole love interest, Elisa Tachibana—only to learn that she went missing three years ago. While the other male survivors adapt accordingly to this new world, Reito instead chooses to pursue Elisa, fight never-ending temptation, and investigate this mysterious virus. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While his fellow teenagers busy themselves with pop culture, Gojou finds bliss in sewing clothes for his dolls. Nonetheless, he goes to great lengths to keep his unique hobby a secret, as he believes that he would be ridiculed were it revealed. \n\nEnter Marin Kitagawa, an extraordinarily pretty girl whose confidence and poise are in stark contrast to Gojou's meekness. It would defy common sense for the friendless Gojou to mix with the likes of Kitagawa, who is always surrounded by her peers. However, the unimaginable happens when Kitagawa discovers Gojou's prowess with a sewing machine and brightly confesses to him about her own hobby: cosplay. Because her sewing skills are pitiable, she decides to enlist his help.\n\nAs Gojou and Kitagawa work together on one cosplay outfit after another, they cannot help but grow close—even though their lives are worlds apart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Friends and strangers alike constantly mistake them for a couple, much to Gojou's embarrassment. After all, in his eyes, their worlds are far too different for anyone to think they could be romantically linked. However, as Gojou spends more time with Kitagawa and realizes that his passions are not ridiculed by other people, a relationship between the two no longer seems so far-fetched.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, despite harboring such large aspirations on the inside, her fear of the unknown and anxiety over her own possible limitations have always held her back from chasing them. But now, in her second year of high school, Mari is more determined than ever to not let any more of her youth go to waste. Still, her fear continues to prevent her from taking that ambitious step forward—that is, until she has a chance encounter with a girl who has grand dreams of her own.\n\nSpurred by her mother's disappearance, Shirase Kobuchizawa has been working hard to fund her trip to Antarctica. Despite facing doubt and ridicule from virtually everyone, Shirase is determined to embark on this expedition to search for her mother in a place further than the universe itself. Inspired by Shirase's resolve, Mari jumps at the chance to join her. Soon, their efforts attract the attention of the bubbly Hinata Miyake, who is eager to stand out, and Yuzuki Shiraishi, a polite girl from a high class background. Together, the four spirited girls set sail toward the frozen south, all in search of something great.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When the party disbands after their victory, Frieren casually returns to her \"usual\" routine of collecting spells across the continent. Due to her different sense of time, she seemingly holds no strong feelings toward the experiences she went through.\n\nAs the years pass, Frieren gradually realizes how her days in the hero's party truly impacted her. Witnessing the deaths of two of her former companions, Frieren begins to regret having taken their presence for granted; she vows to better understand humans and create real personal connections. Although the story of that once memorable journey has long ended, a new tale is about to begin.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In spite of their plots, renowned spy and master of disguise \"Twilight\" fulfills dangerous missions one after another in the hope that no child will have to experience the horrors of war.\n\nIn the bustling Ostanian city of Berlint, Twilight dons the alias of \"Loid Forger,\" an esteemed psychiatrist. However, his true intention is to gather intelligence on prominent politician Donovan Desmond, who only appears rarely in public at his sons' school: the prestigious Eden Academy. Enlisting the help of unmarried city hall clerk Yor Briar to act as his wife and adopting the curious six-year-old orphan Anya as his daughter, Loid enacts his master plan. He will enroll Anya in Eden Academy, where Loid hopes she will excel and give him the opportunity to meet Donovan without arousing suspicion. \n\nUnfortunately for Loid, even a man of his talents has trouble playing the figure of a loving father and husband. And just like Loid is hiding his true identity, Yor—who is an underground assassin known as \"Thorn Princess\"—and Anya—an esper who can read people's minds—have no plans to disclose their own secrets either. Although this picture-perfect family is founded on deception, the Forgers gradually come to understand that the love they share for one another trumps all else.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Sword Art Online (SAO), one of the most recent games on the console, offers a gateway into the wondrous world of Aincrad, a vivid, medieval landscape where users can do anything within the limits of imagination. With the release of this worldwide sensation, gaming has never felt more lifelike.\n\nHowever, the idyllic fantasy rapidly becomes a brutal nightmare when SAO's creator traps thousands of players inside the game. The \"log-out\" function has been removed, with the only method of escape involving beating all of Aincrad's one hundred increasingly difficult levels. Adding to the struggle, any in-game death becomes permanent, ending the player's life in the real world.\n\nWhile Kazuto \"Kirito\" Kirigaya was fortunate enough to be a beta-tester for the game, he quickly finds that despite his advantages, he cannot overcome SAO's challenges alone. Teaming up with Asuna Yuuki and other talented players, Kirito makes an effort to face the seemingly insurmountable trials head-on. But with difficult bosses and threatening dark cults impeding his progress, Kirito finds that such tasks are much easier said than done.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, his peace is short-lived as a new incident occurs in a game called Gun Gale Online, where a player by the name of Death Gun appears to be killing people in the real world by shooting them in-game. Approached by officials to assist in investigating the murders, Kazuto assumes his persona of Kirito once again and logs into Gun Gale Online, intent on stopping the killer.\n\nOnce inside, Kirito meets Sinon, a highly skilled sniper afflicted by a traumatic past. She is soon dragged in his chase after Death Gun, and together they enter the Bullet of Bullets, a tournament where their target is sure to appear. Uncertain of Death Gun's real powers, Kirito and Sinon race to stop him before he has the chance to claim another life. Not everything goes smoothly, however, as scars from the past impede their progress. In a high-stakes game where the next victim could easily be one of them, Kirito puts his life on the line in the virtual world once more.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The private institute Rath aims to perfect their creation by enlisting the aid of Sword Art Online survivor Kazuto Kirigaya. He works there as a part-time employee to test the system's capabilities in the Underworld: the fantastical realm generated by the Soul Translator. As per the confidentiality contract, any memories created by the machine in the virtual world are wiped upon returning to the real world. Kazuto can only vaguely recall a single name, Alice, which provokes a sense of unease when mentioned in reality.\n\nWhen Kazuto escorts Asuna Yuuki home one evening, they chance upon a familiar foe. Kazuto is mortally wounded in the ensuing fight and loses consciousness. When he comes to, he discovers that he has made a full-dive into the Underworld with seemingly no way to escape. He sets off on a quest, seeking a way back to the physical world once again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Reassuming her previous alias, Alice Synthesis Thirty, she promises to defeat the Dark Territory in order to defend the world that Kirito and Eugeo worked so hard to protect.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, things just might change after he meets a bright and bubbly foreigner named Teresa Wagner while he was taking pictures of a cherry blossom tree. Nevertheless, after she asks him to photograph her, the two soon separate, only to meet each other again twice more that same day. Finding Teresa just as she is caught in a sudden downpour, Tada invites her to his family's coffee shop to dry off. There, she explains that she was separated from her traveling companion, a no-nonsense redhead named Alexandra \"Alec\" Magritte. When Alec reunites with Teresa shortly after, they say their goodbyes, expecting to part ways for good—but the two unexpectedly show up as transfer students in his class the next day.\n\nTeresa and Alec quickly get used to their lives at Koinohoshi High School and decide to join Tada in the photography club, along with his narcissistic friend Kaoru Ijuuin, the idol-obsessed Hajime Sugimoto, the serious class rep Hinako Hasegawa, and the dog-like Kentarou Yamashita. With these two peculiar additions to his equally eccentric group of friends, Tada's second year of high school is about to get even livelier, and he might need to start rethinking his approach to love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, as if it was nothing out of the ordinary, a group of unknown men kidnaps him, forcing him to board a flight—where he also encounters a hijacking. Amid the resulting chaos, however, Kimizuka meets a stunning silver-haired beauty, going by the codename Siesta, who then saves the day.\n\nClaiming to be a legendary detective, Siesta enlists Kimizuka to be her sidekick. Though Kimizuka refuses at first, with Siesta's insistence, he eventually joins her—marking the start of a grand adventure spanning the entire world, preventing multiple threats that could spell doom for humanity along the way.\n\nUnfortunately, after three years of their unpredictable yet enjoyable time together, Siesta abruptly passes away. Distraught, Kimizuka tries to leave all memories of her behind, but as he begins to meet more people, it seems that Siesta's influence will never truly die.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately this proves to be harder than she imagined. Her friend Wakana Sakai has given up on singing, for one, and Konatsu needs more than just two members. With only a month left until the recital, will Konatsu be able to find enough members for her club and actually be ready to sing at one of the most important events of the school year and graduate without regrets?",

Also at odds with her goal is the fact that Anis is incapable of using magic despite her noble status. Refusing to give up so easily, she renounces her right to the throne, and focuses on developing \"magicology\" by combining various resources with knowledge from her previous life on Earth.\n\nDue to Anis' nature, responsibility for the kingdom's future is passed onto her younger brother, Algard. Pushed into a political marriage with Euphyllia Magenta, a girl he hardly knows, Algard rebels by spending more time with a commoner girl than his fiancée. After Euphyllia tries to intervene, Algard publicly calls off their marriage and denounces his ex-fiancée as a bully.\n\nAfter crashing into the banquet where Algard makes the announcement, Anis rescues Euphyllia on the flying broom she is testing. She decides to make Euphyllia her assistant, which the other girl reluctantly agrees to. Although their partnership appears random at first, Anis has an ulterior motive for wanting Euphyllia's company.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Contrasting her near-flawless persona, Alya's unmotivated classmate Masachika Kuze slacks off during lessons and seems to show no interest in her.\n\nInitially irritated, Alya gradually becomes more intrigued by Masachika and starts expressing her affection for him in Russian. However, she is oblivious to his secret—he understands the language fluently! Due to a childhood friend who was temporarily staying in Japan, Masachika has been studying Russian in hopes of reuniting with her.\n\nAs the two spend more time together, the playful and eccentric relationship between them quickly deepens. In the meantime, both must learn to navigate their new growing feelings for one another.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Realizing that he will remain indifferent to her affections unless she does something about it, Tomo must find a way to knock some sense into Jun and open his eyes to what is right in front of him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

On his way home one snowy evening, Nasa's eyes fall upon a peerless beauty across the street. Bewitched, Nasa tries to approach her—only to get blindsided by an oncoming truck. \n\nThankfully, his life is spared due to the girl's swift action. Bleeding by the side of an ambulance, he watches as the girl walks away under the moonlight—reminiscent of Princess Kaguya leaving for the moon. Refusing to let this chance meeting end, he forces his crippled body to chase after her and asks her out. Surprised by his foolhardiness and pure resolve, the girl accepts his confession under a single condition: they can only be together if he marries her!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, the bright and cheerful Hiromi has been depressed and cold at home ever since her mother passed away. While he is the subject of the ignorant jealousy of his peers, rumors begin to spread when Shinichirou meets Noe Isurugi—a girl known for cursing classmates, curses which always end up becoming reality.\n\nNoe curses Shinichirou as well, but two pits are created when you curse someone, and her curse on Shinichirou comes back to bite her in the form of a raccoon to her beloved chicken, Raigomaru. Despite this, she does not shed a single tear; Noe had had her tears stolen. For Noe to be able to cry again, she would need the tears of another, and Shinichirou knows a person whose tears he wants to take away.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

These raccoon dogs, who are able to transform into human beings, used to love fooling humans until advanced technology rendered their endeavors futile. However, Mameda, a young tanuki girl, has not given up on this tradition, and—resolved to follow in her father's footsteps—travels to Osaka in hopes of duping people.\n\nAs others in her village predicted, Mameda fails to deceive a single person, and she is even hunted down by an angry crowd. After finding refuge in a theater, she stumbles upon a rakugo performance given by a master of the art, Bunko Daikokutei. Fascinated by the vivid images created by the rakugoka's acting, Mameda becomes enamored with this style of storytelling and decides to become Bunko's apprentice!\n\nDespite her initial reluctance to take a disciple, Bunko begins to teach Mameda rakugo after witnessing the young tanuki's perseverance. Between undertaking a taiko apprenticeship, handling her work at the theater, and memorizing plays, Mameda needs to give her all if she ever plans to master the only art that still has a chance to fool people.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To witness its desolate yet oddly absorbing environment, one must search for portals that could reside anywhere, from secret elevators to shrine entrances.\n\nAfter a fateful encounter with a horrendous Otherworld denizen, Sorawo Kamikoshi ponders whether to keep going or give up in life. Meanwhile, Toriko Nishina scours the Otherworld in hopes of finding her friend Satsuki, who she believes is lost somewhere within the realm. \n\nWhen the two cross paths, friendship blossoms. In order to acquire as much information about this obscure dimension, the two travel back and forth from the real world to the other. Sorawo and Toriko's bodies are soon influenced by the Otherworld, preparing them for the many horrors to come as both of them try to fulfill their goals.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When his grandfather suddenly passes away, he returns to the family home to pay his respects. Upon arriving at the house, he meets a mysterious young girl named Rin who, to Daikichi’s astonishment, is his grandfather's illegitimate daughter!\n \nThe shy and unapproachable girl is deemed an embarrassment to the family, and finds herself ostracized by her father's relatives, all of them refusing to take care of her in the wake of his death. Daikichi, angered by their coldness toward Rin, announces that he will take her in—despite the fact that he is a young, single man with no prior childcare experience.\n\nUsagi Drop is the story of Daikichi's journey through fatherhood as he raises Rin with his gentle and affectionate nature, as well as an exploration of the warmth and interdependence that are at the heart of a happy, close-knit family.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Suddenly, the room is shaken by an unnatural earthquake. Everyone splits up to investigate—except for Nagisa Hanamiya, who stays behind. As everyone leaves, Nagisa notices that the odd relic-like cube that she was toying with starts emitting a strange blue light. Meanwhile, Sou stumbles upon an unconscious, naked girl lying in a pool of water.\n\nUshinawareta Mirai wo Motomete follows the Astronomy Club's increasingly bizarre adventures—from dealing with ghosts to quelling unrests between student clubs.

With her namesake talent in singing, she attempts to join her school's light music club but repeatedly fails due to her extreme shyness and lack of confidence. Intimidated by the dazzling presence of the club's members, Uta fears to even submit her application.\n\nOne day, Uta receives an invitation from Airi Kojou, president of the a cappella club, to check out their club instead. Unlike the light music club, this group performs purely without instruments. Uta soon finds herself amazed by the way the members' voices resonate with one another—delicate yet cohesive, resembling a mille-feuille dessert's thousand layers. Moved, Uta takes a quiet step forward into creating a harmony where everyone shines together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Instead of focusing on the male love interests, Rei obsesses over the romantic rival: the game's villainess, Claire François. One evening, however, Rei's exhaustion catches up with her and she passes away.\n\nWhen Rei opens her eyes again, she finds herself reincarnated as Rae and in the presence of her beloved Claire. Given this miraculous opportunity, she wastes no time declaring her love for the golden-haired villainess and her endearing attempts at bullying. Winning Claire's heart is no easy feat, especially as the game persistently throws the three male leads at Rae—but she has no intention of allowing the dating sim logic to come between her and the one she truly loves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Her father remarried, and her younger half-sister Kaya received all the affection, while Miyo was degraded to a lowly servant. Lacking the strength to fight against her family's abuse, Miyo loses hope that her luck will ever turn.\n\nUnexpectedly, Miyo's father summons her to deliver surprising news: she is to marry Kiyoka Kudou, the head of the distinguished Kudou family. Despite his noble background, Kiyoka is known to be a callous man who has thus far dismissed all of his former fiancées.\n\nUpon arriving at the Kudou household, Miyo expects coarse treatment and to be tossed aside. However, contrary to her assumptions, Kiyoka shows her the kindness and love that she has desperately needed. Marrying Kiyoka may be Miyo's one chance to break free from her neglectful family and embrace a life of happiness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, her cuteness is all a lie—it is purely an act to achieve her self-centered goal of marrying a rich suitor. Though she often plays up her innocence to gain favor from those around her, Hime's facade does not absolve her of responsibility when an accident leaves Mai Koshiba injured.\n\nLearning that Mai is the manager of Café Liebe—a cafe themed as an all-girls academy—Hime is coerced into taking up a part-time position until Mai recovers. However, Hime's facade cannot cover up her shortcomings at being a waitress, earning her the ire of one of her coworkers, Mitsuki Yano, the elegant \"onee-sama\" who often berates Hime over her mistakes. As Hime struggles to adjust to her new job in addition to Mitsuki's unrelenting hostility, her real personality begins seeping through the cracks.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Everything changes one summer when she meets a mysterious girl with eyes as deep and clear as the sea, drawing Hinako in like nothing else has in a long time.\n\nDuring her absent-minded search for the girl, Hinako is suddenly pulled underwater by a beastly deep-sea creature, only to awaken to the presence of the girl—Shiori Oumi—who takes on a monstrous form and kills Hinako's attacker. Despite this heroic act, Shiori's intentions are no different from any other monster's: she wants to eat Hinako.\n\nThe following morning, Shiori walks into Hinako's class as a transfer student, and Hinako cannot help but smile—at last, someone who could fulfill her quiet wish for death has appeared before her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She patiently waits for the wings of love to sprout and send her heart aflutter on the day that she finally receives a confession. Yet, when her classmate from junior high declares his love for her during their graduation, she feels unexpectedly hollow. The realization hits her: she understands romance as a concept, but she is incapable of experiencing the feeling first-hand.\n \nNow, having enrolled in high school, Yuu, disconcerted and dispirited, is still ruminating over how to respond to her suitor. There, she happens upon the seemingly flawless student council president, Touko Nanami, maturely rejecting a confession of her own. Stirred by Touko's elegant manner, Yuu approaches her for advice, only to be bewildered when the president confesses to her! Yuu quickly finds herself in the palm of Touko's hand, and unknowingly sets herself on a path to find the emotion which has long eluded her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Considered a legend in the world of pottery, Himeno's mother suddenly passed away when Himeno was four. However, her legacy lives on in the dozens of unique mugs that adorn the Toyokawas' new restaurant in Tajimi.\n\nHaving moved back to the city recently following the bankruptcy of her father's company in Tokyo, Himeno brings some of her mother's mugs to her first day of high school in an attempt to make friends. One person who immediately takes an interest is Mika Kukuri, an eccentric girl in Himeno's class who soon introduces her to Tooko Aoki, the president of the Pottery Club. After learning more about her mother's contributions to the club and the art form, Himeno asks her father for permission to join, which he gladly gives.\n\nAlongside Mika and her childhood friend Naoko Naruse, Himeno enters the Pottery Club to continue her mother's beloved work and discover her own passion for the craft.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As the two gain more experience with one another in and out of the game, their tentative acquaintance may level up in a way neither expects.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

His monotonous life is interrupted when the peculiar Haru Nonaka makes a lively appearance, frequently dropping by his workplace to befriend him. When Rikuo learns that an old college friend and crush, Shinako Morinome, has moved back into town, he reaches out to further their relationship. Unbeknownst to Rikuo however, Shinako is carrying painful memories from her past that were holding her back from accepting his feelings. Meanwhile, as Haru continually opens up to Rikuo, he discovers that she, much like him, is living by herself and wants to step out of her comfort zone into an uncertain future.\n\nThe past lingers long in the mind, and the future remains elusive. At a crossroads along their intertwined paths, these three experience what it means to let go of their feelings of yesterday and embrace the change that tomorrow brings.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Because he sees little sense in surrendering to the norm, he soon stops going to school. Plagued with insomnia due to his idleness, Kou begins roaming the lonesome streets at night.\n\nOne night, Kou encounters a bizarre girl named Nazuna Nanakusa who believes that people stay awake during the night because they are dissatisfied with how they spent their day and cannot rest until they release their inhibitions. Nazuna offers to help Kou with his sleep issues and invites him over to her place, where she convinces him to share a futon with her. Feeling uncomfortable, Kou only pretends to doze off—which is when Nazuna suddenly bites his neck, revealing herself to be a vampire!\n\nWhile Kou thinks the bite will turn him into a vampire, the specifics of transforming are not that simple. In order to change, he must be bitten by someone he truly loves. Ready to let go of his dreary mortal life, Kou decides on a new goal: he will fall in love with Nazuna and become a vampire himself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, during her commute, Yuki meets fellow student Itsuomi Nagi, a multilingual travel enthusiast and friend of Rin. When Itsuomi learns of Yuki's condition, he takes it in stride, moving Yuki's heart. From this one simple gesture, Yuki and Itsuomi's lives start changing day by day as they let each other into their own worlds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

From pitching her tent to gathering firewood, she has always done everything by herself, and has no plans of leaving her little solitary world.\n\nHowever, what starts off as one of Rin's usual camping sessions somehow ends up as a surprise get-together for two when the lost Nadeshiko Kagamihara is forced to take refuge at her campsite. Originally intending to see the picturesque view of Mount Fuji for herself, Nadeshiko's plans are disrupted when she ends up falling asleep partway to her destination. Alone and with no other choice, she seeks help from the only other person nearby. Despite their hasty introductions, the two girls nevertheless enjoy the chilly night together, eating ramen and conversing while the campfire keeps them warm. And even after Nadeshiko's sister finally picks her up later that night, both girls silently ponder the possibility of another camping trip together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

During the duo's first year, Yui and Kyouko formed the \"Amusement Club\" which occupies the now nonexistent Tea Club's room. Shortly after Akari joins, one of her fellow classmates, Chinatsu Yoshikawa, pays the trio a visit under the impression that they are the Tea Club; it is only once the three girls explain that the Tea Club has been disbanded that they can convince Chinatsu to join the Amusement Club—a group with no purpose other than to provide entertainment for its members.\n\nBased on the slice-of-life manga by Namori, Yuru Yuri is an eccentric comedy about a group of girls who spend their spare time drinking tea and fawning over each other, all while completely failing to even notice the supposed main character Akari amongst them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Whether it's a trip to a hot spring or finishing overdue homework, their lives are never dull, and they will always find an excuse to spend time together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Fans buy into these fabrications, showering their idols with undying love and support, until something breaks the illusion. Sixteen-year-old rising star Ai Hoshino of pop idol group B Komachi has the world captivated; however, when she announces a hiatus due to health concerns, the news causes many to become worried.\n\nAs a huge fan of Ai, gynecologist Gorou Amemiya cheers her on from his countryside medical practice, wishing he could meet her in person one day. His wish comes true when Ai shows up at his hospital—not sick, but pregnant with twins! While the doctor promises Ai to safely deliver her children, he wonders if this encounter with the idol will forever change the nature of his relationship with her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
