Always having her nose in a sketchbook, Asakusa draws detailed landscapes and backgrounds of both the world around her and the one within her boundless imagination. Even the simple act of doodling on a wall evolves into an emergency repair on the outer hull of her spaceship. She is only brought back to reality by her best friend Sayaka Kanamori. The pair are stark opposites, with Asakusa\u0027s childlike wonder contrasted by Kanamori\u0027s calculated approach to life. \n\nAfter a chance encounter where the two \"save\" the young model Tsubame Misuzaki from her overprotective bodyguard, a connection instantly sparks between Asakusa and Misuzaki, as both share an intense passion for art and animation. Whereas Asakusa is interested in backgrounds and settings, Misuzaki loves drawing the human form. Sensing a money-making opportunity, Kanamori suggests that they start an animation club, which they disguise as a motion picture club since the school already has an anime club. Thus begins the trio\u0027s journey of producing animation that will awe the world. \n\nFrom the brilliant mind of Masaaki Yuasa, Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na! is a love letter to animation, wildly creative in its approach, and a testament to the potential of the medium.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]; score=8.13; episodes_count=12; trailer=; anilistId=109298; type=TV; title_english=Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!; title_japanese=æ˜ åƒç ”ã«ã¯æ‰‹ã‚’å‡ºã™ãª!}","episodes":"           ","scrape_errors":""},{"mal_id":150,"title":"Blood+","metadata":"@{id=blood; title=Blood+; malId=150; cover=https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/10183l.jpg; year=2005; season=Fall; studio=Production I.G; source=Original; genres=System.Object[]; themes=System.Object[]; demographic=; synopsis=Saya Otonashi is a seemingly ordinary girl living a mundane life with her adoptive family in Okinawa City.

This small boy has big dreams of reaching the highest class of  sumo, Hinoshita Kaisan. The only way he could possibly go pro is if he becomes the High School Yokozuna, a title given to the strongest wrestler in high school tournaments.\n\nUshio is under a lot of pressure, as well as a time limit. If he can\u0027t show off his skills in the high school tournaments, he may lose his chance to go pro permanently, and the odds are stacked against him. Instead of enrolling in Ishigami High, the best school for sumo in Japan, he enrolls in Odachi High and must build a sumo club from the ground up with the one devout member Shinya Ozeki. Odachi High is the true underdog of the sumo world, but Ushio has to push forward with all his strength if he is going to make it professionally.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]; score=7.52; episodes_count=24; anilistId=100990; trailer=; type=TV; title_english=Hinomaru Sumo; title_japanese=ç«ãƒŽä¸¸ç›¸æ’²}","episodes":"                       ","scrape_errors":""},{"mal_id":551,"title":"Grappler Baki: Saidai Tournament-hen","metadata":"@{id=grappler-baki-saidai-tournament-hen; title=Grappler Baki: Saidai Tournament-hen; malId=551; cover=https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1433/96723l.jpg; year=2001; season=Summer; studio=Group TAC; source=Manga; genres=System.Object[]; themes=System.Object[]; demographic=Shounen; synopsis=Mitsunari Tokugawa, the organizer of the historic Tokugawa underground fighting ring, has created a tournament featuring 38 of the world\u0027s best fighters, many of whom are grandmasters in their respective form of martial arts.

She was once childhood friends with the now prominent martial arts athlete Rinne Berlinetta, but the personality of her fellow orphan shifted from kind and gentle to cold and cruel after being adopted by a prosperous family and starting martial arts.\n\nNonetheless, Fuuka soon accepts Einhald\u0027s offer and begins training under herâ€”not only out of necessity but also out of the desire to defeat Rinne and make her realize how hurtful her behavior has become. Despite Fuuka\u0027s inexperience, Einhald and the other members of the gym have faith in her talent and efforts.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]; score=6.96; episodes_count=12; anilistId=21871; trailer=; type=TV; title_english=; title_japanese=ViVid Strike!}","episodes":"           ","scrape_errors":""},{"mal_id":1956,"title":"Ikkitousen: Dragon Destiny","metadata":"@{id=ikkitousen-dragon-destiny; title=Ikkitousen: Dragon Destiny; malId=1956; cover=https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/85202l.jpg; year=2007; season=Winter; studio=Arms; source=Manga; genres=System.Object[]; themes=System.Object[]; demographic=Seinen; synopsis=The fierce confrontation among the Kanto high schools reaches new heights with the awakening of dragons in the Kyousho and Seito Academy\u0027s leaders, Moutoku Sousou and Gentoku Ryuubi.

While on the way to attend his first day at his new school, Ren notices a strange app has appeared on his phone, transferring him to a world known as the Metaverse, which contains people\u0027s \"shadows\": distorted depictions of their true selves. In the Metaverse, he awakens his Persona, a power from deep within that gives him the strength to fight the shadows. With the help of similarly troubled students, he forms the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, attempting to save people from their sinful desires by \"taking their heart,\" making evildoers regret their actions and turn over a new leaf. The group\u0027s reputation continues to grow explosively, bringing along fame both positive and negative.\n\nHowever, during the peak of their popularity, Ren gets captured and taken into custody. Here, he wakes up to a harsh interrogation, but this is cut short by the arrival of Sae Niijimaâ€”a prosecutor seeking answers. Just how will she react to his story, and what will become of the Phantom Thieves? \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]; score=6.44; episodes_count=26; anilistId=99693; trailer=; type=TV; title_english=Persona 5 the Animation; title_japanese=TVã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡ã€Œãƒšãƒ«ã‚½ãƒŠï¼•ã€}","episodes":"                         ","scrape_errors":""},{"mal_id":36432,"title":"Toaru Majutsu no Index III","metadata":"@{id=toaru-majutsu-no-index-iii; title=Toaru Majutsu no Index III; malId=36432; cover=https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1583/93857l.jpg; year=2018; season=Fall; studio=J.C.Staff; source=Light novel; genres=System.Object[]; themes=System.Object[]; demographic=; synopsis=Touma Kamijou can\u0027t catch a break.

With countless coaches fired and poor financial choices in hiring players, it is a downward spiral for ETU.\n\nThe board of directors, under pressure from general manager Kousei Gotou, takes a gamble and hires a new coachâ€”the slightly eccentric Takeshi Tatsumi. Though considered a great soccer player when he was younger, Tatsumi abandoned ETU years ago. However, since then, he has proven himself successful as the manager of one of England\u0027s lower division amateur teams.\n\nTatsumi\u0027s task won\u0027t be easy; ETU fans call him a traitor, and the team is pitted against others with larger budgets and better players. Yet even the underdog can take down a goliath, and Tatsumi claims he is an expert at giant killing.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]; score=7.53; episodes_count=26; anilistId=7661; trailer=; type=TV; title_english=Giant Killing; title_japanese=ã‚¸ãƒ£ã‚¤ã‚¢ãƒ³ãƒˆã‚­ãƒªãƒ³ã‚°}","episodes":"                         ","scrape_errors":""},{"mal_id":39583,"title":"number24","metadata":"@{id=number24; title=number24; malId=39583; cover=https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1371/134464l.jpg; year=2020; season=Winter; studio=PRA; source=Original; genres=System.Object[]; themes=System.Object[]; demographic=; synopsis=Natsuza Yuzuki has been playing rugby as a left-winger ever since he was a child.
