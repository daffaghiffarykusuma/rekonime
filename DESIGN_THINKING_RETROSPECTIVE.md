# Design Thinking Retrospective

## What went well
- Clear criteria for similarity (genre + theme) kept recommendations focused.
- Alignment to retention and satisfaction preserved user intent.

## What could improve
- Run the similarity tests against real data to validate ranking behavior.
- Consider a fallback when genre/theme tags are missing.

## Next steps
- Validate with real modal interactions and tune weights if needed.
