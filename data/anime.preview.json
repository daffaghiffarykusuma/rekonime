With the Yorozuya nowhere in sight, the bakufu all but collapsed, and the Shogun missing, the people are left completely helpless as the Liberation Army begins pillaging Edo in the name of freeing them from the Tendoshuu's rule. \n\nCaught in the crossfire between two equally imposing forces, can Gintoki, Kagura, Shinpachi, and the former students of Shouyou Yoshida put aside their differences and unite their allies to protect what they hold dear?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","communityScore":8.81,"searchText":"gintama. shirogane no tamashii-hen gintama. silver soul arc 銀魂. 銀ノ魂篇","episodes":[{"episode":1,"score":4.8},{"episode":2,"score":4.9},{"episode":3,"score":4.8},{"episode":4,"score":4.8},{"episode":5,"score":4.7},{"episode":6,"score":4.7},{"episode":7,"score":4.6},{"episode":8,"score":4.4},{"episode":9,"score":4.6},{"episode":10,"score":4.7},{"episode":11,"score":4.7},{"episode":12,"score":4.6}],"stats":{"average":4.69,"stdDev":0.13,"auc":90,"consistency":{"label":"Very Consistent","class":"consistency-high"},"scoreClass":"score-excellent","episodeCount":12,"highestScore":4.9,"lowestScore":4.4,"retentionScore":80,"malSatisfactionScore":8.81,"reliabilityScore":88,"sessionSafety":96,"threeEpisodeHook":94,"habitBreakRisk":2.5,"peakScore":4.9,"finaleStrength":50,"worthFinishing":41,"peakEpisodeCount":0,"momentum":-1,"narrativeAcceleration":0.03,"comfortScore":98,"stressSpikes":0,"emotionalStability":97,"barrierToEntry":0.06,"flowState":100,"qualityTrend":{"slope":-0.02,"direction":"stable"},"qualityDips":[],"productionQualityIndex":79,"rollingAverage":[{"episode":3,"rollingAvg":4.83},{"episode":4,"rollingAvg":4.83},{"episode":5,"rollingAvg":4.77},{"episode":6,"rollingAvg":4.73},{"episode":7,"rollingAvg":4.67},{"episode":8,"rollingAvg":4.57},{"episode":9,"rollingAvg":4.53},{"episode":10,"rollingAvg":4.57},{"episode":11,"rollingAvg":4.67},{"episode":12,"rollingAvg":4.67}],"controversyPotential":21,"sharkJump":null,"churnRisk":{"score":4,"label":"Low Risk","factors":["Overall quality below peak baseline"]},"slowBurn":{"signal":0,"isActive":false,"momentumScore":50,"finaleStrength":50}},"colorIndex":754},{"id":"mushishi-zoku-shou-2nd-season","title":"Mushishi Zoku Shou 2nd Season","titleEnglish":"Mushi-shi: Next Passage Part 2","titleJapanese":"蟲師 続章","malId":24701,"anilistId":20751,"cover":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/68095l.jpg","type":"TV","year":2014,"season":"Fall","studio":"Artland","source":"Manga","genres":["Adventure","Mystery","Slice of Life","Supernatural"],"themes":["Adult Cast","Historical","Iyashikei"],"demographic":"Seinen","trailer":{"site":"youtube","id":"zuX3P6ynAgc","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuX3P6ynAgc","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zuX3P6ynAgc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zuX3P6ynAgc/hqdefault.jpg","source":"jikan"},"synopsis":"Ghostly, primordial beings known as Mushi continue to cause mysterious changes in the lives of humans. The travelling Mushishi, Ginko, persists in trying to set right the strange and unsettling situations he encounters. Time loops, living shadows, and telepathy are among the overt effects of interference from Mushi, but more subtle symptoms that take years to be noticed also rouse Ginko's concern as he passes from village to village.\n\nThrough circumstance, Ginko has become an arbiter, determining which Mushi are blessings and which are curses. But the lines that he seeks to draw are subjective. Some of his patients would rather exercise their new powers until they are utterly consumed by them; others desperately strive to rid themselves of afflictions which are in fact protecting their lives from devastation. Those who cross paths with Mushi must learn to accept seemingly impossible consequences for their actions, and heal wounds they did not know they had.

Their interactions are brief, limited to Suzuki's unprompted random questions and Tani's succinct answers. Yet, beneath these simple exchanges, feelings of love are quietly blossoming.\n\nSuzuki sees Tani for who he is: a straightforward boy who respects everyone equally, completely unconcerned about fitting in. Unlike Tani, she is too hung up on what everyone else thinks, desperate to keep her crush a secret. However, a slight misunderstanding leads to Suzuki confessing her feelings—and to her delight, Tani feels the same.

being polar opposites, Makoto \"Smile\" Tsukimoto and Yutaka \"Peco\" Hoshino have been best friends since childhood. Although the overly confident Peco strives to be the best ping-pong player in the world, he often skips practice, earning the ire of his fellow teammates on the Katase High School ping-pong team. Meanwhile, Smile—in spite of his innate talent for the sport—cannot help but hold back his full strength when playing against others. Through their mutual love for ping-pong, the two have developed a bond that is seemingly unbreakable.\n\nWhen Peco hears that an ex-national team player from China is coming to Japan, he drags Smile over to rival Tsujido High School to observe them. The subsequent trip leads to a clash between Peco and Kong Wenge, who overwhelmingly defeats the former in one game. Stunned by such a comprehensive loss, Peco finds himself questioning why he plays to begin with. Seeing his potential as a player, Katase's coach begins to train Smile to overcome his hesitation, but he is reluctant to play if it is not for enjoyment.\n\nAs the two struggle to find meaning in the sport, a plethora of stronger players—each with their own internal strifes—await them at the inter-high tournament, where only the very best can persevere. But when these young athletes let their unbridled ambition go unchecked, the hardships they face paint a somber reality as they pursue glory.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","communityScore":8.63,"searchText":"ping pong the animation ping pong the animation ピンポン the animation","episodes":[{"episode":1,"score":4.4},{"episode":2,"score":4.6},{"episode":3,"score":4.6},{"episode":4,"score":4.6},{"episode":5,"score":4.6},{"episode":6,"score":4.8},{"episode":7,"score":4.6},{"episode":8,"score":4.8},{"episode":9,"score":4.9},{"episode":10,"score":4.8},{"episode":11,"score":4.8}],"stats":{"average":4.68,"stdDev":0.14,"auc":89,"consistency":{"label":"Very Consistent","class":"consistency-high"},"scoreClass":"score-excellent","episodeCount":11,"highestScore":4.9,"lowestScore":4.4,"retentionScore":79,"malSatisfactionScore":8.63,"reliabilityScore":90,"sessionSafety":96,"threeEpisodeHook":85,"habitBreakRisk":0.9,"peakScore":4.9,"finaleStrength":52,"worthFinishing":43,"peakEpisodeCount":0,"momentum":8,"narrativeAcceleration":0.02,"comfortScore":98,"stressSpikes":0,"emotionalStability":97,"barrierToEntry":0.08,"flowState":100,"qualityTrend":{"slope":0.04,"direction":"stable"},"qualityDips":[],"productionQualityIndex":81,"rollingAverage":[{"episode":3,"rollingAvg":4.53},{"episode":4,"rollingAvg":4.6},{"episode":5,"rollingAvg":4.6},{"episode":6,"rollingAvg":4.67},{"episode":7,"rollingAvg":4.67},{"episode":8,"rollingAvg":4.73},{"episode":9,"rollingAvg":4.77},{"episode":10,"rollingAvg":4.83},{"episode":11,"rollingAvg":4.83}],"controversyPotential":21,"sharkJump":null,"churnRisk":{"score":4,"label":"Low Risk","factors":["Overall quality below peak baseline"]},"slowBurn":{"signal":0,"isActive":false,"momentumScore":54,"finaleStrength":52}},"colorIndex":559},{"id":"3-gatsu-no-lion-2nd-season","title":"3-gatsu no Lion 2nd Season","titleEnglish":"March Comes In Like a Lion 2nd Season","titleJapanese":"3月のライオン 第2シリーズ","malId":35180,"anilistId":98478,"cover":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/88469l.jpg","type":"TV","year":2017,"season":"Fall","studio":"Shaft","source":"Manga","genres":["Drama"],"themes":["Childcare","Strategy Game"],"demographic":"Seinen","trailer":{"site":"youtube","id":"OfSaJb5OOPA","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfSaJb5OOPA","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OfSaJb5OOPA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OfSaJb5OOPA/hqdefault.jpg","source":"jikan"},"synopsis":"Now in his second year of high school, Rei Kiriyama continues pushing through his struggles in the professional shogi world as well as his personal life.

That is until one night, a seemingly small event changes Dr. Tenma's life forever. While preparing to perform surgery on someone, he gets a call from the hospital director telling him to switch patients and instead perform life-saving brain surgery on a famous performer. His fellow doctors, fiancée, and the hospital director applaud his accomplishment; but because of the switch, a poor immigrant worker is dead, causing Dr. Tenma to have a crisis of conscience.\n\nSo when a similar situation arises, Dr. Tenma stands his ground and chooses to perform surgery on the young boy Johan Liebert instead of the town's mayor. Unfortunately, this choice leads to serious ramifications for Dr. Tenma—losing his social standing being one of them. However, with the mysterious death of the director and two other doctors, Dr. Tenma's position is restored. With no evidence to convict him, he is released and goes on to attain the position of hospital director. \n\nNine years later when Dr. Tenma saves the life of a criminal, his past comes back to haunt him—once again, he comes face to face with the monster he operated on. He must now embark on a quest of pursuit to make amends for the havoc spread by the one he saved.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","communityScore":8.89,"searchText":"monster monster

the conclusion of the large-scale coalition campaign, the entirety of China is in a state of economic recovery. The victor of the battle, the state of Qin, is no different. There, the political parties led by Ying Zheng and Buwei Lü continue their inner conflict. Having played the role of king in the coalition battle, Zheng has the trust of the people—but Lü is far from out of the fight. In 18 months, he plans to interrupt Zheng's coming-of-age ceremony.\n\nMeanwhile, a Zhao army numbering 20,000 troops has set out toward Qin. In the royal court, due to the lack of generals capable of responding to the incoming threat, Lü slyly suggests that Zheng take command. However, Cheng Jiao, Zheng's half-brother, volunteers instead. As they grew to trust each other during the coalition battle, Zheng now accepts Jiao as his replacement.\n\nHowever, the Zhao forces retreat a mere half-day after clashing with Jiao's army. With trouble quickly brewing in the shadows, the internal struggle of Qin is only complicated further. There are only two men Zheng feels he can rely on: Bi, a general who commands 30,000 men; and Xin, the leader of the Fei Xin force.\n\n[Written by MAL

What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal war against the Titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","communityScore":8.57,"searchText":"shingeki no kyojin attack on titan 進撃の巨人","episodes":[{"episode":1,"score":4.6},{"episode":2,"score":4.5},{"episode":3,"score":4.5},{"episode":4,"score":4.7},{"episode":5,"score":4.7},{"episode":6,"score":4.6},{"episode":7,"score":4.7},{"episode":8,"score":4.8},{"episode":9,"score":4.7},{"episode":10,"score":4.4},{"episode":11,"score":4.4},{"episode":12,"score":4.3},{"episode":13,"score":4.6},{"episode":14,"score":4.6},{"episode":15,"score":4.4},{"episode":16,"score":4.5},{"episode":17,"score":4.8},{"episode":18,"score":4.7},{"episode":19,"score":4.6},{"episode":20,"score":4.6},{"episode":21,"score":4.8},{"episode":22,"score":4.7},{"episode":23,"score":4.7},{"episode":24,"score":4.7},{"episode":25,"score":4.6}],"stats":{"average":4.61,"stdDev":0.13,"auc":87,"consistency":{"label":"Very Consistent","class":"consistency-high"},"scoreClass":"score-excellent","episodeCount":25,"highestScore":4.8,"lowestScore":4.3,"retentionScore":78,"malSatisfactionScore":8.57,"reliabilityScore":90,"sessionSafety":95,"threeEpisodeHook":85,"habitBreakRisk":1.2,"peakScore":4.8,"finaleStrength":51,"worthFinishing":41,"peakEpisodeCount":0,"momentum":3,"narrativeAcceleration":0.01,"comfortScore":97,"stressSpikes":0,"emotionalStability":96,"barrierToEntry":0.09,"flowState":100,"qualityTrend":{"slope":0,"direction":"stable"},"qualityDips":[],"productionQualityIndex":78,"rollingAverage":[{"episode":3,"rollingAvg":4.53},{"episode":4,"rollingAvg":4.57},{"episode":5,"rollingAvg":4.63},{"episode":6,"rollingAvg":4.67},{"episode":7,"rollingAvg":4.67},{"episode":8,"rollingAvg":4.7},{"episode":9,"rollingAvg":4.73},{"episode":10,"rollingAvg":4.63},{"episode":11,"rollingAvg":4.5},{"episode":12,"rollingAvg":4.37},{"episode":13,"rollingAvg":4.43},{"episode":14,"rollingAvg":4.5},{"episode":15,"rollingAvg":4.53},{"episode":16,"rollingAvg":4.5},{"episode":17,"rollingAvg":4.57},{"episode":18,"rollingAvg":4.67},{"episode":19,"rollingAvg":4.7},{"episode":20,"rollingAvg":4.63},{"episode":21,"rollingAvg":4.67},{"episode":22,"rollingAvg":4.7},{"episode":23,"rollingAvg":4.73},{"episode":24,"rollingAvg":4.7},{"episode":25,"rollingAvg":4.67}],"controversyPotential":21,"sharkJump":null,"churnRisk":{"score":4,"label":"Low Risk","factors":["Overall quality below peak baseline"]},"slowBurn":{"signal":0,"isActive":false,"momentumScore":52,"finaleStrength":51}},"colorIndex":326},{"id":"fatestrange-fake","title":"Fate/strange Fake","titleEnglish":"Fate/strange Fake","titleJapanese":"Fate/strange Fake","malId":55830,"anilistId":166617,"cover":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1752/150192l.jpg","type":"TV","year":2026,"season":"Winter","studio":"A-1 Pictures","source":"Light novel","genres":["Action","Fantasy"],"themes":["Urban Fantasy"],"trailer":{"site":"youtube","id":"EzbZP62K1-Q","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzbZP62K1-Q","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EzbZP62K1-Q?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EzbZP62K1-Q/hqdefault.jpg","source":"jikan"},"synopsis":"Fate/strange Fake centers around an imperfect copy of a Grail War based on the Third Holy Grail War in Fuyuki. Following the conclusion of the third Grail War, a US-based organization with magi distinct from the London-based Mage Association, used data from Fuyuki's Grail War to plan their own ritual. Seventy years later, they used the city of Snowfield as the Sacred Land for their own Grail War. However, they were unable to successfully replicate every aspect of the ritual, resulting in it acting only as an imitation that has lost the Saber class and allowed for the summoning of strange Servants due to the blurring of the definition of a \"hero.\"\n\nRohngall and his pupil, Faldeus, have been dispatched by the Mage's Association to investigate the city and the state of the war. Faldeus, a US organization spy, has Rohngall sniped upon his arrival, despite knowing that Rohngall is a puppet.

His former partner C.C., unable to accept this turn of events, takes it upon herself to remind him of his past purpose, hoping that the mastermind Zero will rise once again to finish what he started.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","communityScore":8.91,"searchText":"code geass: hangyaku no lelouch r2 code geass: lelouch of the rebellion r2 コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュ r2","episodes":[{"episode":1,"score":4.4},{"episode":2,"score":4.7},{"episode":3,"score":4.6},{"episode":4,"score":4.6},{"episode":5,"score":4.6},{"episode":6,"score":4.6},{"episode":7,"score":4.5},{"episode":8,"score":4.5},{"episode":9,"score":4.4},{"episode":10,"score":4.4},{"episode":11,"score":4.5},{"episode":12,"score":4.2},{"episode":13,"score":4.6},{"episode":14,"score":4.6},{"episode":15,"score":4.6},{"episode":16,"score":4.6},{"episode":17,"score":4.5},{"episode":18,"score":4.7},{"episode":19,"score":4.7},{"episode":20,"score":4.6},{"episode":21,"score":4.6},{"episode":22,"score":4.4},{"episode":23,"score":4.4},{"episode":24,"score":4.5},{"episode":25,"score":4.8}],"stats":{"average":4.54,"stdDev":0.13,"auc":85,"consistency":{"label":"Very Consistent","class":"consistency-high"},"scoreClass":"score-excellent","episodeCount":25,"highestScore":4.8,"lowestScore":4.2,"retentionScore":77,"malSatisfactionScore":8.91,"reliabilityScore":85,"sessionSafety":94,"threeEpisodeHook":86,"habitBreakRisk":2.4,"peakScore":4.8,"finaleStrength":50,"worthFinishing":39,"peakEpisodeCount":0,"momentum":1,"narrativeAcceleration":0,"comfortScore":97,"stressSpikes":0,"emotionalStability":97,"barrierToEntry":0.1,"flowState":100,"qualityTrend":{"slope":0,"direction":"stable"},"qualityDips":[],"productionQualityIndex":78,"rollingAverage":[{"episode":3,"rollingAvg":4.57},{"episode":4,"rollingAvg":4.63},{"episode":5,"rollingAvg":4.6},{"episode":6,"rollingAvg":4.6},{"episode":7,"rollingAvg":4.57},{"episode":8,"rollingAvg":4.53},{"episode":9,"rollingAvg":4.47},{"episode":10,"rollingAvg":4.43},{"episode":11,"rollingAvg":4.43},{"episode":12,"rollingAvg":4.37},{"episode":13,"rollingAvg":4.43},{"episode":14,"rollingAvg":4.47},{"episode":15,"rollingAvg":4.6},{"episode":16,"rollingAvg":4.6},{"episode":17,"rollingAvg":4.57},{"episode":18,"rollingAvg":4.6},{"episode":19,"rollingAvg":4.63},{"episode":20,"rollingAvg":4.67},{"episode":21,"rollingAvg":4.63},{"episode":22,"rollingAvg":4.53},{"episode":23,"rollingAvg":4.47},{"episode":24,"rollingAvg":4.43},{"episode":25,"rollingAvg":4.57}],"controversyPotential":22,"sharkJump":null,"churnRisk":{"score":5,"label":"Low Risk","factors":["Overall quality below peak baseline"]},"slowBurn":{"signal":0,"isActive":false,"momentumScore":51,"finaleStrength":50}},"colorIndex":363},{"id":"kusuriya-no-hitorigoto","title":"Kusuriya no Hitorigoto","titleEnglish":"The Apothecary Diaries","titleJapanese":"薬屋のひとりごと","malId":54492,"anilistId":161645,"cover":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1708/138033l.jpg","type":"TV","year":2023,"season":"Fall","studio":["OLM","TOHO animation STUDIO"],"source":"Light novel","genres":["Drama","Mystery"],"themes":["Historical","Medical"],"trailer":{"site":"youtube","id":"hkflaNu6yAQ","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkflaNu6yAQ","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hkflaNu6yAQ?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hkflaNu6yAQ/hqdefault.jpg","source":"jikan"},"synopsis":"Maomao, an apothecary's daughter, has been plucked from her peaceful life and sold to the lowest echelons of the imperial court.

To this end, he publicly states his intention to study theology—the academic field held in highest regard in early 15th century Poland. However, an encounter with a mysterious man upends Rafal's life, sparking an illogical desire to instead pursue his passion for astronomy.\n\nRafal is determined to prove the beauty and rationality of heliocentrism—the theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun. This belief is considered heretical by the powerful Church, which promotes geocentrism—the Sun revolving around the Earth—as the sole truth of the universe. Those whose beliefs do not align with the will of the Church suffer unfathomably gruesome consequences.\n\nIn pursuit of evidence for a heliocentric model of the universe, Rafal grapples with obtaining precise calculations and building empirical theories. His greatest challenge, however, lies in conducting this research discreetly—lest he wish to meet the same fate as other heretics.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","communityScore":8.71,"searchText":"chi. chikyuu no undou ni tsuite orb: on the movements of the earth チ。―地球の運動について―","episodes":[{"episode":1,"score":4.4},{"episode":2,"score":4.4},{"episode":3,"score":4.7},{"episode":4,"score":4.4},{"episode":5,"score":4.4},{"episode":6,"score":4.6},{"episode":7,"score":4.5},{"episode":8,"score":4.5},{"episode":9,"score":4.6},{"episode":10,"score":4.4},{"episode":11,"score":4.6},{"episode":12,"score":4.7},{"episode":13,"score":4.6},{"episode":14,"score":4.7},{"episode":15,"score":4.7},{"episode":16,"score":4.4},{"episode":17,"score":4.4},{"episode":18,"score":4.6},{"episode":19,"score":4.6},{"episode":20,"score":4.6},{"episode":21,"score":4.6},{"episode":22,"score":4.7},{"episode":23,"score":4.8},{"episode":24,"score":4.5},{"episode":25,"score":4.3}],"stats":{"average":4.55,"stdDev":0.13,"auc":85,"consistency":{"label":"Very Consistent","class":"consistency-high"},"scoreClass":"score-excellent","episodeCount":25,"highestScore":4.8,"lowestScore":4.3,"retentionScore":77,"malSatisfactionScore":8.71,"reliabilityScore":90,"sessionSafety":94,"threeEpisodeHook":84,"habitBreakRisk":0.8,"peakScore":4.8,"finaleStrength":50,"worthFinishing":39,"peakEpisodeCount":0,"momentum":-1,"narrativeAcceleration":-0.01,"comfortScore":97,"stressSpikes":0,"emotionalStability":96,"barrierToEntry":0.12,"flowState":100,"qualityTrend":{"slope":0,"direction":"stable"},"qualityDips":[],"productionQualityIndex":77,"rollingAverage":[{"episode":3,"rollingAvg":4.5},{"episode":4,"rollingAvg":4.5},{"episode":5,"rollingAvg":4.5},{"episode":6,"rollingAvg":4.47},{"episode":7,"rollingAvg":4.5},{"episode":8,"rollingAvg":4.53},{"episode":9,"rollingAvg":4.53},{"episode":10,"rollingAvg":4.5},{"episode":11,"rollingAvg":4.53},{"episode":12,"rollingAvg":4.57},{"episode":13,"rollingAvg":4.63},{"episode":14,"rollingAvg":4.67},{"episode":15,"rollingAvg":4.67},{"episode":16,"rollingAvg":4.6},{"episode":17,"rollingAvg":4.5},{"episode":18,"rollingAvg":4.47},{"episode":19,"rollingAvg":4.53},{"episode":20,"rollingAvg":4.6},{"episode":21,"rollingAvg":4.6},{"episode":22,"rollingAvg":4.63},{"episode":23,"rollingAvg":4.7},{"episode":24,"rollingAvg":4.67},{"episode":25,"rollingAvg":4.53}],"controversyPotential":21,"sharkJump":null,"churnRisk":{"score":5,"label":"Low Risk","factors":["Overall quality below peak baseline"]},"slowBurn":{"signal":0,"isActive":false,"momentumScore":50,"finaleStrength":50}},"colorIndex":630},{"id":"uma-musume-cinderella-gray-part-2","title":"Uma Musume: Cinderella Gray Part 2","titleEnglish":"Umamusume: Cinderella Gray Part 2","titleJapanese":"ウマ娘 シンデレラグレイ 第2クール","malId":61930,"anilistId":195240,"cover":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1120/152280l.jpg","type":"TV","year":2025,"season":"Fall","studio":"CygamesPictures","source":"Manga","genres":["Drama","Sports"],"themes":["Anthropomorphic","Racing"],"demographic":"Seinen","trailer":{"site":"youtube","id":"9xGGAYRtDAA","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xGGAYRtDAA","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9xGGAYRtDAA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9xGGAYRtDAA/hqdefault.jpg","source":"jikan"},"synopsis":"Ever since horse girl Oguri Cap left the small town of Kasamatsu to chase greater heights in Tokyo, she has rapidly gained attention with her remarkable results.

Through the use of advanced magic, an explorer can sometimes be resurrected, allowing them to learn from past mistakes and give traversing the dungeon another go. However, when a powerful dragon eats Falin, Laios' spellcasting sister, she sends her brother and his companions back to the beginning to save them from permanent ends.\n\nThough strapped for cash and equipment, Laios resolves to fight his way through the dungeon and rescue Falin before she can be digested by the dragon. Despite some of Laios' allies abandoning him, two remain by his side: elven mage Marcille Donato and halfling locksmith Chilchuck Tims. Due to their lack of funds, the party faces the daunting prospect of starving before being able to complete their quest. However, they find salvation in Senshi, a dwarven warrior with a penchant for cooking and safely eating defeated monsters.\n\nWith Senshi's culinary expertise, Laios and his companions struggle

Despite this heroic act, Shiori's intentions are no different from any other monster's: she wants to eat Hinako.\n\nThe following morning, Shiori walks into Hinako's class as a transfer student, and Hinako cannot help but smile—at last, someone who could fulfill her quiet wish for death has appeared before her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","communityScore":7.42,"searchText":"watashi wo tabetai, hitodenashi this monster wants to eat me 私を喰べたい、ひとでなし","episodes":[{"episode":1,"score":4.2},{"episode":2,"score":4.3},{"episode":3,"score":4.3},{"episode":4,"score":4.5},{"episode":5,"score":4.4},{"episode":6,"score":4.3},{"episode":7,"score":4.3},{"episode":8,"score":4.5},{"episode":9,"score":4.5},{"episode":10,"score":4.6},{"episode":11,"score":4.6},{"episode":12,"score":4.5},{"episode":13,"score":4.3}],"stats":{"average":4.41,"stdDev":0.13,"auc":81,"consistency":{"label":"Very Consistent","class":"consistency-high"},"scoreClass":"score-good","episodeCount":13,"highestScore":4.6,"lowestScore":4.2,"retentionScore":75,"malSatisfactionScore":7.42,"reliabilityScore":81,"sessionSafety":92,"threeEpisodeHook":76,"habitBreakRisk":2.3,"peakScore":4.6,"finaleStrength":51,"worthFinishing":40,"peakEpisodeCount":0,"momentum":3,"narrativeAcceleration":0,"comfortScore":97,"stressSpikes":0,"emotionalStability":97,"barrierToEntry":0.1,"flowState":100,"qualityTrend":{"slope":0.02,"direction":"stable"},"qualityDips":[],"productionQualityIndex":76,"rollingAverage":[{"episode":3,"rollingAvg":4.27},{"episode":4,"rollingAvg":4.37},{"episode":5,"rollingAvg":4.4},{"episode":6,"rollingAvg":4.4},{"episode":7,"rollingAvg":4.33},{"episode":8,"rollingAvg":4.37},{"episode":9,"rollingAvg":4.43},{"episode":10,"rollingAvg":4.53},{"episode":11,"rollingAvg":4.57},{"episode":12,"rollingAvg":4.57},{"episode":13,"rollingAvg":4.47}],"controversyPotential":20,"sharkJump":null,"churnRisk":{"score":7,"label":"Low Risk","factors":["Overall quality below peak baseline"]},"slowBurn":{"signal":0,"isActive":false,"momentumScore":52,"finaleStrength":51}},"colorIndex":290},{"id":"hunter-x-hunter-2011","title":"Hunter x Hunter (2011)","titleEnglish":"Hunter x Hunter","titleJapanese":"HUNTER×HUNTER（ハンター×ハンター）","malId":11061,"anilistId":11061,"cover":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1337/99013l.jpg","type":"TV","year":2011,"season":"Fall","studio":"Madhouse","source":"Manga","genres":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"themes":[],"demographic":"Shounen","trailer":{"site":"youtube","id":"D9iTQRB4XRk","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9iTQRB4XRk","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D9iTQRB4XRk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D9iTQRB4XRk/hqdefault.jpg","source":"jikan"},"synopsis":"Hunters devote themselves to accomplishing hazardous tasks, all from traversing the world's uncharted territories to locating rare items and monsters. Before becoming a Hunter, one must pass the Hunter Examination—a high-risk selection process in which most applicants end up handicapped or worse, deceased.\n\nAmbitious participants who challenge the notorious exam carry their own reason. What drives 12-year-old Gon Freecss is finding Ging, his father and a Hunter himself. Believing that he will meet his father by becoming a Hunter, Gon takes the first step to walk the same path.\n\nDuring the Hunter Examination, Gon befriends the medical student Leorio Paladiknight, the vindictive Kurapika, and ex-assassin Killua Zoldyck. While their motives vastly differ from each other, they band together for a common goal and begin to venture into a perilous world.\n\n[Written by MAL

While Yoi keeps telling herself that it is nothing serious, even she cannot completely ignore the stir Kohaku causes in her heart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","communityScore":7.54,"searchText":"uruwashi no yoi no tsuki in the clear moonlit dusk うるわしの宵の月","episodes":[{"episode":1,"score":4.25},{"episode":2,"score":4.43}],"stats":{"average":4.34,"stdDev":0.09,"auc":78,"consistency":{"label":"Very Consistent","class":"consistency-high"},"scoreClass":"score-good","episodeCount":2,"highestScore":4.43,"lowestScore":4.25,"retentionScore":74,"malSatisfactionScore":7.54,"reliabilityScore":73,"sessionSafety":91,"threeEpisodeHook":78,"habitBreakRisk":5,"peakScore":4.43,"finaleStrength":52,"worthFinishing":40,"peakEpisodeCount":0,"momentum":0,"narrativeAcceleration":0,"comfortScore":96,"stressSpikes":0,"emotionalStability":94,"barrierToEntry":0.09,"flowState":100,"qualityTrend":{"slope":0,"direction":"stable"},"qualityDips":[],"productionQualityIndex":74,"rollingAverage":[],"controversyPotential":0,"sharkJump":null,"churnRisk":{"score":8,"label":"Low Risk","factors":["Overall quality below peak baseline"]},"slowBurn":{"signal":0,"isActive":false,"momentumScore":50,"finaleStrength":52}},"colorIndex":3419},{"id":"bad-girl","title":"Bad Girl","titleEnglish":"Bad Girl","titleJapanese":"ばっどがーる","malId":59161,"anilistId":178675,"cover":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1672/148848l.jpg","type":"TV","year":2025,"season":"Summer","studio":"Bridge","source":"4-koma manga","genres":["Comedy"],"themes":["CGDCT","School"],"trailer":{"site":"youtube","id":"QUeiRyKjsmE","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUeiRyKjsmE","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QUeiRyKjsmE","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QUeiRyKjsmE/hqdefault.jpg","source":"anilist"},"synopsis":"High school first year Yuu Yuutani has always been a good girl, following the rules, helping out around her house, and generally going through life unnoticed. From afar, she reveres her upperclassman and the school's Public Decency Officer, Atori Mizutori, and desperately wants her attention. When she realizes that the best way to get Atori to notice her is to be a delinquent, she begins to dress differently: she dyes parts of her hair a bright red, wears clips on her ears to resemble piercings, and attaches jumbo erasers to her shoes to give them thicker soles.\n\nDespite Yuu's best efforts and even with the advice of her \"natural born delinquent\" friend Suzu Suzukaze, all of her plans to be a bad girl go awry. Still, Yuu manages to befriend Atori and pledges to spend as much time as possible together, not knowing there are others vying for Atori's attention. In the process, Yuu has also gained the attention of the school's self-proclaimed idol, Rura Ruriha, filling her once-invisible life with more attention than she may be able to handle.\n\n[Written by

The youngest daughter, Constance Grail, is just as moral as the rest of her family, believing in always doing the right thing and helping those in need.\n\nHowever, these ideals do not help her when her fiancé cheats on her with another woman. Framed by his lover in the hope of her downfall, Constance has no one to hear her pleas for justice. Everyone turns a blind eye, save for one—the spirit of the infamous Scarlet Castiel—who possesses Constance and turns the tables on her accuser. However, this aid does not come without a price.\n\nTen years ago, Scarlet was executed for the attempted murder of Princess Cecilia. But this was actually a setup; as blunt and harsh as Scarlet could be, she would never stoop so low as to use poison. She has no idea who orchestrated her incrimination, but Scarlet demands that Constance—as the only one who can see her—help her exact revenge on all those who wronged her!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","communityScore":7.2,"searchText":"eris no seihai the holy grail of eris エリスの聖杯","episodes":[{"episode":1,"score":4.17},{"episode":2,"score":4.23}],"stats":{"average":4.2,"stdDev":0.03,"auc":74,"consistency":{"label":"Very Consistent","class":"consistency-high"},"scoreClass":"score-good","episodeCount":2,"highestScore":4.23,"lowestScore":4.17,"retentionScore":72,"malSatisfactionScore":7.2,"reliabilityScore":70,"sessionSafety":89,"threeEpisodeHook":74,"habitBreakRisk":5,"peakScore":4.23,"finaleStrength":50,"worthFinishing":39,"peakEpisodeCount":0,"momentum":0,"narrativeAcceleration":0,"comfortScore":99,"stressSpikes":0,"emotionalStability":98,"barrierToEntry":0.03,"flowState":100,"qualityTrend":{"slope":0,"direction":"stable"},"qualityDips":[],"productionQualityIndex":73,"rollingAverage":[],"controversyPotential":0,"sharkJump":null,"churnRisk":{"score":9,"label":"Low Risk","factors":["Overall quality below peak baseline"]},"slowBurn":{"signal":0,"isActive":false,"momentumScore":50,"finaleStrength":50}},"colorIndex":2564},{"id":"mayonaka-heart-tune","title":"Mayonaka Heart Tune","titleEnglish":"Tune In to the Midnight Heart","titleJapanese":"真夜中ハートチューン","malId":61211,"anilistId":187942,"cover":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1769/152823l.jpg","type":"TV","year":2026,"season":"Winter","studio":"Gekkou","source":"Manga","genres":["Comedy","Romance"],"themes":["Harem","School","Showbiz"],"demographic":"Shounen","trailer":{"site":"youtube","id":"poUibdNvxPQ","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poUibdNvxPQ","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/poUibdNvxPQ","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/poUibdNvxPQ/hqdefault.jpg","source":"anilist"},"synopsis":"","communityScore":7.23,"searchText":"mayonaka heart tune tune in to the midnight heart 真夜中ハートチューン","episodes":[{"episode":1,"score":4},{"episode":2,"score":4.3}],"stats":{"average":4.15,"stdDev":0.15,"auc":72,"consistency":{"label":"Very Consistent","class":"consistency-high"},"scoreClass":"score-good","episodeCount":2,"highestScore":4.3,"lowestScore":4,"retentionScore":71,"malSatisfactionScore":7.23,"reliabilityScore":54,"sessionSafety":52,"threeEpisodeHook":72,"habitBreakRisk":5,"peakScore":4.3,"finaleStrength":54,"worthFinishing":41,"peakEpisodeCount":0,"momentum":0,"narrativeAcceleration":0,"comfortScore":93,"stressSpikes":0,"emotionalStability":90,"barrierToEntry":0.15,"flowState":99,"qualityTrend":{"slope":0,"direction":"stable"},"qualityDips":[],"productionQualityIndex":71,"rollingAverage":[],"controversyPotential":0,"sharkJump":null,"churnRisk":{"score":9,"label":"Low Risk","factors":["Overall quality below peak baseline"]},"slowBurn":{"signal":0,"isActive":false,"momentumScore":50,"finaleStrength":54}},"colorIndex":170},{"id":"kirei-ni-shitemoraemasu-ka","title":"Kirei ni Shitemoraemasu ka.","titleEnglish":"Wash It All Away","titleJapanese":"綺麗にしてもらえますか。","malId":61782,"anilistId":194028,"cover":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1940/154234l.jpg","type":"TV","year":2026,"season":"Winter","studio":"Okuruto Noboru","source":"Manga","genres":["Slice of Life"],"themes":[],"demographic":"Seinen","trailer":{"site":"youtube","id":"URcT4mR6KSU","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URcT4mR6KSU","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/URcT4mR6KSU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/URcT4mR6KSU/hqdefault.jpg","source":"jikan"},"synopsis":"With an endearing protagonist and luscious art, this seaside slice-of-life story offers tranquility in the chaos of the modern world.

Eikichi Onizuka—ex-biker gang leader, conqueror of Shonan, and virgin—has a dream: to become the greatest high school teacher in all of Japan. This isn't because of a passion for teaching, but because he wants a loving teenage wife when he's old and gray. Still, for a perverted, greedy, and lazy delinquent, there is more to Onizuka than meets the eye. So when he lands a job as the homeroom teacher of the Class 3-4 at the prestigious Holy Forest Academy—despite suplexing the Vice Principal—all of his talents are put to the test, as this class is particularly infamous.\n\nDue to their utter contempt for all teachers, the class' students use psychological warfare to mentally break any new homeroom teacher they get, forcing them to quit and leave school. However, Onizuka isn't your average teacher, and he's ready for any challenge in his way.\n\nBullying, suicide, and sexual harassment are just a few of the issues his students face daily. By tackling the roots of their problems, Onizuka supports them with his unpredictable and unconventional methods—even if it means jumping off a building to save a suicidal child. Thanks to his eccentric charm and fun-loving nature, Class 3-4 slowly learns just how enjoyable school can be when you're the pupils of the Great Teacher Onizuka.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","communityScore":8.68,"searchText":"great teacher onizuka great teacher onizuka グレート・ティーチャー・オニヅカ","episodes":[{"episode":1,"score":4.4},{"episode":2,"score":4.3},{"episode":3,"score":4.4},{"episode":4,"score":4.3},{"episode":5,"score":4.5},{"episode":6,"score":4.5},{"episode":7,"score":4.5},{"episode":8,"score":4.4},{"episode":9,"score":4.4},{"episode":10,"score":4.3},{"episode":11,"score":4.5},{"episode":12,"score":4.3},{"episode":13,"score":4.3},{"episode":14,"score":4.4},{"episode":15,"score":4.8},{"episode":16,"score":4.4},{"episode":17,"score":4.5},{"episode":18,"score":4.3},{"episode":19,"score":4.6},{"episode":20,"score":4.2},{"episode":21,"score":4},{"episode":22,"score":4},{"episode":23,"score":4.3},{"episode":24,"score":4.5},{"episode":25,"score":4.1},{"episode":26,"score":4.2},{"episode":27,"score":4.3},{"episode":28,"score":4.4},{"episode":29,"score":4.3},{"episode":30,"score":4.4},{"episode":31,"score":4.5},{"episode":32,"score":4.5},{"episode":33,"score":4.7},{"episode":34,"score":4},{"episode":35,"score":4.4},{"episode":36,"score":4.1},{"episode":37,"score":4.5},{"episode":38,"score":4.4},{"episode":39,"score":4.6},{"episode":40,"score":4.6},{"episode":41,"score":4.7},{"episode":42,"score":4.4},{"episode":43,"score":4.5}],"stats":{"average":4.39,"stdDev":0.18,"auc":80,"consistency":{"label":"Very Consistent","class":"consistency-high"},"scoreClass":"score-good","episodeCount":43,"highestScore":4.8,"lowestScore":4,"retentionScore":60,"malSatisfactionScore":8.68,"reliabilityScore":72,"sessionSafety":86,"threeEpisodeHook":79,"habitBreakRisk":0.9,"peakScore":4.8,"finaleStrength":51,"worthFinishing":42,"peakEpisodeCount":0,"momentum":7,"narrativeAcceleration":0.02,"comfortScore":97,"stressSpikes":0,"emotionalStability":94,"barrierToEntry":0.07,"flowState":100,"qualityTrend":{"slope":0,"direction":"stable"},"qualityDips":[],"productionQualityIndex":68,"rollingAverage":[{"episode":3,"rollingAvg":4.37},{"episode":4,"rollingAvg":4.33},{"episode":5,"rollingAvg":4.4},{"episode":6,"rollingAvg":4.43},{"episode":7,"rollingAvg":4.5},{"episode":8,"rollingAvg":4.47},{"episode":9,"rollingAvg":4.43},{"episode":10,"rollingAvg":4.37},{"episode":11,"rollingAvg":4.4},{"episode":12,"rollingAvg":4.37},{"episode":13,"rollingAvg":4.37},{"episode":14,"rollingAvg":4.33},{"episode":15,"rollingAvg":4.5},{"episode":16,"rollingAvg":4.53},{"episode":17,"rollingAvg":4.57},{"episode":18,"rollingAvg":4.4},{"episode":19,"rollingAvg":4.47},{"episode":20,"rollingAvg":4.37},{"episode":21,"rollingAvg":4.27},{"episode":22,"rollingAvg":4.07},{"episode":23,"rollingAvg":4.1},{"episode":24,"rollingAvg":4.27},{"episode":25,"rollingAvg":4.3},{"episode":26,"rollingAvg":4.27},{"episode":27,"rollingAvg":4.2},{"episode":28,"rollingAvg":4.3},{"episode":29,"rollingAvg":4.33},{"episode":30,"rollingAvg":4.37},{"episode":31,"rollingAvg":4.4},{"episode":32,"rollingAvg":4.47},{"episode":33,"rollingAvg":4.57},{"episode":34,"rollingAvg":4.4},{"episode":35,"rollingAvg":4.37},{"episode":36,"rollingAvg":4.17},{"episode":37,"rollingAvg":4.33},{"episode":38,"rollingAvg":4.33},{"episode":39,"rollingAvg":4.5},{"episode":40,"rollingAvg":4.53},{"episode":41,"rollingAvg":4.63},{"episode":42,"rollingAvg":4.57},{"episode":43,"rollingAvg":4.53}],"controversyPotential":24,"sharkJump":null,"churnRisk":{"score":38,"label":"Moderate Risk","factors":["Minor slump (2 consecutive weak episodes)","Overall quality below peak baseline"]},"slowBurn":{"signal":0,"isActive":false,"momentumScore":54,"finaleStrength":51}},"colorIndex":495},{"id":"natsume-yuujinchou-roku","title":"Natsume Yuujinchou Roku","titleEnglish":"Natsume's Book of Friends Season 6","titleJapanese":"夏目友人帳 陸","malId":34591,"anilistId":97983,"cover":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/84416l.jpg","type":"TV","year":2017,"season":"Spring","studio":"Shuka","source":"Manga","genres":["Slice of Life","Supernatural"],"themes":["Iyashikei","Mythology"],"demographic":"Shoujo","trailer":{"site":"youtube","id":"mea4xITAo_4","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mea4xITAo_4","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mea4xITAo_4","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mea4xITAo_4/hqdefault.jpg","source":"youtube-search"},"synopsis":"Takashi Natsume has grown accustomed to his encounters with youkai through the Book of Friends, which contains the names of youkai whom his grandmother, Reiko Natsume, has sealed in contracts.

In contrast, the realm of death gods is a humdrum, unchanging gambling den. The ingenious 17-year-old Japanese student Light Yagami and sadistic god of death Ryuk share one belief: their worlds are rotten.\n\nFor his own amusement, Ryuk drops his Death Note into the human world. Light stumbles upon it, deeming the first of its rules ridiculous: the human whose name is written in this note shall die. However, the temptation is too great, and Light experiments by writing a felon's name, which disturbingly enacts his first murder.\n\nAware of the terrifying godlike power that has fallen into his hands, Light—under the alias Kira—follows his wicked sense of justice with the ultimate goal of cleansing the world of all evil-doers. The meticulous mastermind detective L is already on his trail, but as Light's brilliance rivals L's, the grand chase for Kira turns into an intense battle of wits that can only end when one of them is

Unlike the light music club, this group performs purely without instruments. Uta soon finds herself amazed by the way the members' voices resonate with one another—delicate yet cohesive, resembling a mille-feuille dessert's thousand layers.

Ignoring the alchemical principle banning human transmutation, the boys attempted to bring their recently deceased mother back to life. Instead, they suffered brutal personal loss: Alphonse's body disintegrated while Edward lost a leg and then sacrificed an arm to keep Alphonse's soul in the physical realm by binding it to a hulking suit of armor.\n\nThe brothers are rescued by their neighbor Pinako Rockbell and her granddaughter Winry. Known as a bio-mechanical engineering prodigy, Winry creates prosthetic limbs for Edward by utilizing \"automail,\" a tough, versatile metal used in robots and combat armor. After years of training, the Elric brothers set off on a quest to restore their bodies by locating the Philosopher's Stone—a powerful gem that allows an alchemist to defy the traditional laws of Equivalent Exchange.\n\nAs Edward becomes an infamous alchemist and gains the nickname \"Fullmetal,\" the boys' journey embroils them in a growing conspiracy that threatens the fate of the

the mid-21st century, Tokyo's criminal underworld is ruled by Demon Lords—crime bosses who have undergone ether enhancement surgery, granting them terrifying superpowers. The only ones who can take them down are Heroes, bounty hunters who boost their own ether powers using the drug E3 (E-Three).

That is, until Jougamine, a high school girl and self-proclaimed \"apprentice,\" forces her way into his life. Reluctantly taking her under his wing, Yashiro soon finds himself caught in a whirlwind of deadly conflicts.\n\n(Source: MAL News)","communityScore":6.58,"searchText":"yuusha no kuzu scum of the brave 勇者のクズ","episodes":[{"episode":1,"score":3.68},{"episode":2,"score":3.96}],"stats":{"average":3.82,"stdDev":0.14,"auc":62,"consistency":{"label":"Very Consistent","class":"consistency-high"},"scoreClass":"score-good","episodeCount":2,"highestScore":3.96,"lowestScore":3.68,"retentionScore":43,"malSatisfactionScore":6.58,"reliabilityScore":24,"sessionSafety":18,"threeEpisodeHook":62,"habitBreakRisk":5,"peakScore":3.96,"finaleStrength":54,"worthFinishing":41,"peakEpisodeCount":0,"momentum":0,"narrativeAcceleration":0,"comfortScore":94,"stressSpikes":0,"emotionalStability":91,"barrierToEntry":0.14,"flowState":99,"qualityTrend":{"slope":0,"direction":"stable"},"qualityDips":[],"productionQualityIndex":54,"rollingAverage":[],"controversyPotential":0,"sharkJump":null,"churnRisk":{"score":76,"label":"Critical Drop-off Risk","factors":["Minor slump (2 consecutive weak episodes)","Poor recent episodes (last 2 below p35 baseline)","Overall quality below peak baseline"]},"slowBurn":{"signal":0,"isActive":false,"momentumScore":50,"finaleStrength":54}},"colorIndex":2113},{"id":"tomodachi-no-imouto-ga-ore-ni-dake-uzai","title":"Tomodachi no Imouto ga Ore ni dake Uzai","titleEnglish":"My Friend's Little Sister Has It In for Me!","titleJapanese":"友達の妹が俺にだけウザい","malId":47158,"anilistId":129195,"cover":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1699/151694l.jpg","type":"TV","year":2025,"season":"Fall","studio":"Blade","source":"Light novel","genres":["Comedy","Romance"],"themes":["School"],"trailer":{"site":"youtube","id":"s8ihe-Mb1Po","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ihe-Mb1Po","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s8ihe-Mb1Po","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s8ihe-Mb1Po/hqdefault.jpg","source":"anilist"},"synopsis":"If a girl teases you, that means she likes you!\n\nUnfortunately, Akiteru knows from experience that isn't the case.
